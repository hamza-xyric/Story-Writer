## Chapter 1: Why I Write

*The Origin of This Book*

---

I have been wanting to write a book my whole life.

I think there have been a lot of different occasions when I almost started one. I'd get this urge, you know, and I'd think about all the things I wanted to say, all the stories I wanted to tell. But then the questions would come. How do I start? What do I include? What order does everything go in? There were just too many things I didn't know how to manage, so I didn't.

Now with how AI can really tailor and help you with everything, I came up with this idea. Not just to write a book, but to document my whole life.

My idea is simple. I didn't wanna just sit down one day and start writing from beginning to end. That felt impossible. Instead, I wanna slowly just write on it. Whatever I'm thinking about at the moment, that's what I write. Like if I feel like thinking about my university right now, I write about my university. Tomorrow I don't feel like thinking about anything. And then suddenly I have this urge to think about my cat. And then I just start writing about my cat.

I wanna do this and I want AI to kind of just put the pieces in place and keep on building a story. Because what I'm gonna be talking about are different characters—friends from different times, family, people who shaped me. I'm gonna be talking about different events. I'm gonna be talking about myself at different times. How I was when I was young. How I am now. The friends I had then, the friends I have now. And then kind of just like my whole life. And then be like, yes, this is me.

Book is just nice and cool to say. But at the end it's kind of a detailed dream. I want my emotions in there and I generally want to express myself as much as I can. So I don't forget this later on.

There will obviously be a lot to add, a lot of changes, a lot of different ideas. It's very cool and I really feel like there is so much that happens that doesn't get captured. I wanna capture all these moments before they fade away.
