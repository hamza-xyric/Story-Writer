## The CLEAR Review Method

|--------|-------|-----------|
| **C**orrectness | Does it work? | Solves the problem? Edge cases? |
| **L**ogic | Is it sound? | Bugs? Race conditions? Off-by-one? |
| **E**fficiency | Is it performant? | Complexity? Unnecessary operations? |
| **A**rchitecture | Is it well-designed? | Separation of concerns? SOLID? |
| **R**eadability | Is it maintainable? | Clear naming? Good comments? |

## Xyric Rules

1. **Understand before reviewing** - read PR description, check context
2. **Be specific and actionable** - "Line 32 needs null check" not "fix bugs"
3. **Be constructive** - explain WHY, suggest alternatives
4. **Acknowledge good work** - note well-done patterns
5. **Focus on what matters** - don't nitpick style when logic is broken
