# DOC-OPS-07: YouTube Key Points Extractor

**Skill ID**: DOC-OPS-07
**Category**: Document Operations
**Priority**: High
**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-22

---

## Purpose

Extract structured, reusable data from YouTube video analyses (DOC-OPS-06 output) to feed downstream workflows. This skill transforms comprehensive analysis documents into actionable data blocks for:

- **Social Media**: Pre-formatted Twitter/LinkedIn snippets
- **Database Import**: YAML for EverythingAI tool aggregation
- **PDF Export**: Key moments with timestamps and screenshot placeholders

---

## Pipeline Position

```
DOC-OPS-05 (Transcript)
    --> DOC-OPS-06 (Full Analysis)
        --> DOC-OPS-07 (Key Points Extraction)
            |
            +--> social_snippets --> CONTENT-01/02 --> Social Posts
            |
            +--> everythingai_import --> Tool Database YAML
            |
            +--> pdf_export --> DOC-OPS-01 --> PDF Document
```

DOC-OPS-07 is a **downstream skill** that processes DOC-OPS-06 output into structured, automation-ready data.

---

## When to Activate

**Triggers**:

## Video Type Adaptations

Different video types require different extraction focus:

| Video Type | Key Moments Focus | Ratings | Pros/Cons | DB Import | Special Focus |
|------------|-------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `tutorial` | Step completions, tool setups | No | No | No | Action items, prerequisites |
| `review` | Feature demos, verdict reveals | Yes | Yes | Yes | Tool assessment, pricing |
| `comparison` | Winner reveals, head-to-head | Yes | Per-tool | Yes | Decision matrix |
| `interview` | Insight moments, revelations | No | No | No | Notable quotes, guest wisdom |
| `news` | Announcement times, updates | No | No | No | Timeline, implications |
| `explainer` | Concept reveals, examples | No | No | No | Analogies, learning moments |
| `case-study` | Results shown, milestones | No | No | No | Metrics, replicability |
| `trading` | Setup reveals, target levels | No | No | No | Trade setups, risk levels |

### Type-Specific Behavior

**For `review` and `comparison` types:**
- Populate full `ratings`, `pros_cons`, and `everythingai_import` sections
- Focus key moments on feature demonstrations and verdict statements

**For `tutorial` types:**
- Skip ratings/pros_cons (mark `applicable: false`)
- Focus key moments on step completions and "gotcha" moments
- Emphasize actionable takeaways

**For `interview` types:**
- Skip ratings/pros_cons (mark `applicable: false`)
- Maximize quotable_snippets extraction
- Focus on guest insights and wisdom

**For all types:**
- Always generate `key_moments`, `takeaways`, `social_snippets`, and `pdf_export`
- Adapt social snippet tone to video type

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Input Validation

**Accept**:
- Path to DOC-OPS-06 analysis document (preferred)
- Video URL + request to process (will check for existing analysis)

**Validate**:
- Analysis document has required sections (Quick Summary, Key Timestamps, etc.)
- Video type is identifiable from frontmatter

**If no analysis exists**:
- Suggest: "No analysis found. Would you like me to run DOC-OPS-06 first?"
- Chain skills if user confirms

### Phase 2: Content Parsing

Read the analysis document and extract:

1. **Frontmatter metadata** - video_url, channel, video_type, duration
2. **Key Timestamps section** - basis for key_moments
3. **Pros/Cons sections** - if review/comparison type
4. **Quotes and notable statements** - for quotable_snippets
5. **Summary and conclusions** - for takeaways

### Phase 3: Key Moments Extraction

From the Key Timestamps table:
- Select top 5-8 most significant moments
- Assign importance levels (high/medium/low)
- Generate screenshot placeholders with descriptive text
- Tag each moment for categorization

**Importance Criteria**:
- **High**: Verdict reveals, major feature demos, critical insights
- **Medium**: Supporting points, secondary features, context
- **Low**: Transitions, minor details, supplementary info

### Phase 4: Social Snippet Generation

**For Twitter (2-3 options)**:
- Hook + key insight + optional CTA
- Under 280 characters (aim for 240 for retweet room)
- Include relevant hashtags (2-3 max)

**For LinkedIn (1-2 options)**:
- Professional tone hook
- Value-focused body (2-3 sentences)
- Insight highlight
- Clear CTA

**Snippet Guidelines**:
- Lead with the most compelling insight
- Use active voice
- Include specific numbers/results when available
- Match tone to video type (technical for tutorials, opinionated for reviews)

### Phase 5: Database Formatting

**For review/comparison types only**:
- Extract tool information (name, category, URL)
- Compile pros/cons as simple arrays
- Identify sentiment (analyze language tone)
- Note any explicit ratings given
- Document comparisons made

### Phase 6: Output Generation

**Option A: Append to Analysis**
- Add `## Key Points Extract` section to existing analysis
- Preserve original document, add YAML block at end

**Option B: Standalone File**
- Create `[Video-Title]-Key-Points.md` file
- Store in same directory as analysis
- Reference source analysis in metadata

**Default**: Option A (append) unless user specifies standalone

---

## Output File Naming

**Appended to analysis**:
```
[Original-Analysis].md  (modified with Key Points Extract section)
```

**Standalone file**:
```
[Video-Title]-Key-Points.md
```

**Storage location** (if standalone):
```
CONTENT/youtube/{type}/YYYY-MM/[Video-Title]-Key-Points.md
```

---

## Quick Reference Commands

### Read Analysis Document
```bash
cat "/path/to/CONTENT/youtube/{type}/YYYY-MM/[Analysis].md"
```

### Count Key Timestamps
```bash
grep -c "| [0-9]" "/path/to/analysis.md"
```

### Extract Frontmatter Video Type
```bash
grep "video_type:" "/path/to/analysis.md" | cut -d'"' -f2
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do not** extract key points without reading the full analysis
- **Do not** generate EverythingAI import for non-review types
- **Do not** exceed Twitter character limits in social snippets
- **Do not** include timestamps that don't exist in source
- **Do not** fabricate quotes - only use attributable statements
- **Do not** skip importance assignment for key moments

---

## Best Practices

- **Always** verify video type before selecting extraction approach
- **Always** include screenshot placeholders with descriptive text
- **Always** count characters for social snippets
- **Always** preserve original quotes accurately
- **Always** mark non-applicable sections clearly
- **Always** reference source analysis in metadata
- **Always** generate at least 2 Twitter and 1 LinkedIn snippet

---

## Error Handling

### No Analysis Found
- Suggest running DOC-OPS-06 first
- Offer to chain skills automatically

### Missing Key Timestamps
- Note in output that timestamps were unavailable
- Generate key moments from content analysis instead

### Unknown Video Type
- Ask user to specify
- Default to generic extraction (no ratings/DB import)

### Analysis Too Short
- Minimum: 500 words for meaningful extraction
- If shorter: Note limited extraction possible
