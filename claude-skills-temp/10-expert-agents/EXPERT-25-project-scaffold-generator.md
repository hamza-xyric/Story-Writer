# EXPERT-25: Project Scaffold Generator

**Version**: 1.0
**Category**: Expert Agents
**Purpose**: Automates creation of properly linked folder structures for new products and projects

---

## Overview

The Project Scaffold Generator creates standardized folder structures with the correct linking files (PROGRESS.md, README.md, PROJECT.md) for new products and projects. It ensures consistency across the repository and sets up the foundation for documentation without generating actual content.

**Key Principle**: Structure only - no content generation. Folders remain "empty" until populated by other skills or manual work.

---

## Activation

```
Act as EXPERT-25 Project Scaffold Generator
```

**Triggers**:
- "Create a new product folder for..."
- "Set up project structure for..."
- "Initialize folder for..."
- "Scaffold new product..."

---

## Capabilities

### 1. Product Folder Setup (PRODUCTS/)

Creates the standard product folder structure:

```
PRODUCTS/<product-name>/
├── README.md              # Folder purpose, lifecycle stage, links
├── PROGRESS.md            # Session continuity tracking
├── context/               # Empty - for personas, pillars, terminology
├── prd-epics/             # Empty - for Epic PRD documents
├── stories/               # Empty - for user story documents
└── design/                # Empty - for design system docs
```

**README.md Content**:
```markdown
# <Product Name>

> **Lifecycle Stage**: Vision
> **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
> **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Purpose
[Brief description of product purpose]

## Folder Contents

| Folder | Purpose | Documents |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `context/` | Product context files | personas, pillars, terminology, constraints |
| `prd-epics/` | Epic PRD documents | PRD-Epic-01.md, PRD-Epic-02.md, etc. |
| `stories/` | User story documents | Epic-01-Stories.md, etc. |
| `design/` | Design system documentation | Color-System.md, Typography.md, etc. |

## Key Documents

- **Product-Vision.md** - Product vision and strategy (create with EXPERT-20)
- **Product-Requirements-Document.md** - Full PRD (create with EXPERT-21)
- **PROGRESS.md** - Session tracking and continuity

## Related Links

- Project Work Items: `PROJECTS/PRODUCT/<project-folder>/`
- Implementation (if applicable): `<repo-name>/`

**PROGRESS.md**: Uses template from `FRAMEWORKS/templates/progress-template.md`

### 2. Project Folder Setup (PROJECTS/)

Creates work item project structure:

```
PROJECTS/<type>/<project-name>/
├── PROJECT.md             # Project metadata, links to PRODUCTS
├── README.md              # Project purpose and structure
├── epics/                 # Empty - for work item epics
├── stories/               # Empty - for work item stories
└── sprints/               # Empty - for sprint tracking
```

**Project Types**:
- `PRODUCT/` - Product development projects
- `CLIENT/` - Client engagement projects
- `INTERNAL/` - Internal operations projects

**PROJECT.md Content**:
```yaml
---
type: project
id: <PROJECT-CODE>-P01
title: <Project Title>
status: todo
priority: P1
lead: hamza-muqeem
labels: []

# <Project Title>

### 3. Validation

Checks existing structure for completeness:

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] All required folders exist
- [ ] README.md exists in root
- [ ] PROGRESS.md exists for products
- [ ] PROJECT.md exists for projects
- [ ] Folder naming follows conventions

---

## Workflow

### Creating a Product Folder

1. **Gather Information**:
   - Product name (will be converted to folder name)
   - Brief description
   - Initial lifecycle stage (default: Vision)

2. **Create Structure**:
   ```
   mkdir -p PRODUCTS/<product-name>/{context,prd-epics,stories,design}
   ```

3. **Generate Files**:
   - Create README.md with product overview
   - Create PROGRESS.md from template
   - Create empty .gitkeep in each subfolder

4. **Report**:
   - List created folders and files
   - Provide next steps guidance

### Creating a Project Folder

1. **Gather Information**:
   - Project name
   - Project type (PRODUCT/CLIENT/INTERNAL)
   - Linked product (for PRODUCT type)
   - Project code prefix (e.g., YH, DRAI, MASCON)

2. **Create Structure**:
   ```
   mkdir -p PROJECTS/<type>/<project-name>/{epics,stories,sprints}
   ```

3. **Generate Files**:
   - Create PROJECT.md with frontmatter
   - Create README.md with structure guide
   - Create empty .gitkeep in each subfolder

4. **Link to Products** (if applicable):
   - Add references to PRODUCTS documentation
   - Set kb_path in PROJECT.md frontmatter

---

## Naming Conventions

### Product Folders
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `yhealth-platform`, `dr-ai-healthcare`
- Match official product name from PRODUCTS/README.md

### Project Folders
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `yhealth-platform`, `mascon`
- Match product or client name

### Project Codes
| Product/Client | Code |
|----------------|------|
| yHealth Platform | YH |
| DR AI Healthcare | DRAI |
| yBusiness Platform | YB |
| EverythingAI | EVAI |
| Trading Data Warehouse | TDW |
| PropertyAI | PAI |
| Mascon (Client) | MASCON |

## Output Examples

### Example: Creating Product Folder

**Input**: "Create product folder for a new AI assistant called SmartHelper"

**Output**:
```
Created product structure: PRODUCTS/smarthelper/

Folders created:
  ├── context/
  ├── prd-epics/
  ├── stories/
  └── design/

Files created:
  ├── README.md (product overview)
  └── PROGRESS.md (session tracking)

Next Steps:
1. Use EXPERT-20 to generate Product-Vision.md
2. Use EXPERT-21 to generate Product-Requirements-Document.md
3. Create context files in context/ folder
4. Update PROGRESS.md with session goals

Lifecycle Stage: Vision
```

### Example: Creating Project Folder

**Input**: "Create project folder for yHealth Platform implementation"

**Output**:
```
Created project structure: PROJECTS/PRODUCT/yhealth-platform/

Folders created:
  ├── epics/
  ├── stories/
  └── sprints/

Files created:
  ├── PROJECT.md (project metadata)
  └── README.md (structure guide)

Links configured:
  - kb_path: /PRODUCTS/yhealth-platform
  - Project code: YH

Next Steps:
1. Create epics in epics/ folder using EXPERT-22
2. Create stories using EXPERT-13
3. Update PROJECT.md with team assignments
4. Track progress in PRODUCTS/yhealth-platform/PROGRESS.md
```

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| EXPERT-20 Vision Generator | After creating product folder, to generate Product-Vision.md |
| EXPERT-21 PRD Generator | After Vision, to generate Product-Requirements-Document.md |
| EXPERT-22 Epic Generator | After PRD, to generate Epic PRD documents |
| EXPERT-13 Story Generator | After Epics, to generate user stories |

---

## Anti-Patterns

**DO NOT**:
- Generate Vision, PRD, or other content documents (that's for other skills)
- Create folders that don't follow naming conventions
- Skip creating linking files (README.md, PROGRESS.md)
- Create deeply nested structures beyond the standard pattern

**DO**:
- Always create all standard subfolders
- Always include linking files
- Follow existing naming conventions in the repository
- Provide clear next steps after creation

---

## Validation Command

To validate existing structure:

```
Validate folder structure for PRODUCTS/<product-name>
```

**Output**:
```
Validation Report: PRODUCTS/yhealth-platform/

✅ Root folder exists
✅ README.md present
✅ PROGRESS.md present
✅ context/ folder exists (6 files)
✅ prd-epics/ folder exists (10 files)
✅ stories/ folder exists (7 files)
✅ design/ folder exists (11 files)

Status: VALID - All required structure in place
```
