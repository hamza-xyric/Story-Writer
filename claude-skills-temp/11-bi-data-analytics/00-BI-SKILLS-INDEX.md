## Usage Guidelines

### For Client Projects (Sequential Workflow)
1. **Discovery Phase (BI-02)**: Generate business questions and hypotheses FIRST
   - Understand business context
   - Apply 12 question categories
   - Formulate testable hypotheses
   - Define segmentation strategy
2. **Proposal Phase**: Reference both BI-02 (strategic thinking) and BI-01 (methodology) in proposals
3. **Design Phase (BI-01)**: Design dashboards based on BI-02 questions
   - Questions define metrics hierarchy
   - Hypotheses inform dashboard structure
   - Segmentation drives interactivity
4. **Development Phase**: Build dashboards following BI-01 best practices
5. **Launch Phase**: Train clients on the thinking (BI-02) and the tool (BI-01)

### For Internal Training
- **Start with BI-02**: Learn to think before analyzing
- **Then study BI-01**: Learn to visualize effectively
- Use both as reference during project work
- Apply BI-02 quality checks before BI-01 design

### For Proposals
- Differentiate through BI-02 strategic thinking + BI-01 visualization methodology
- Show sample questions (BI-02) and dashboard approach (BI-01)
- Justify premium pricing with proven frameworks
