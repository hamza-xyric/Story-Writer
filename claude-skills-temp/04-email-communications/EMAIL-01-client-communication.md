# EMAIL-01: Client Communication

## Purpose

Creates professional, personalized client emails that position Xyric as an embedded partner, not an external vendor. Every email should feel like it comes from a team member working alongside the client, not a consultant delivering to them.

---

## The Xyric Way: Client Communication

### Core Philosophy

**We're your team, not your vendor.**

Client communication at Xyric follows three principles:

| Principle | What It Means | How to Execute |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Client Sets the Pace** | Communication cadence adapts to them | Daily, weekly, or async - whatever they prefer |
| **Embedded Partner** | Sound like a team member, not an outsider | "We found" not "We discovered for you" |
| **Personalization First** | Every email is tailored | No copy-paste templates without customization |

### Partnership Voice

The difference between vendor and partner communication:

| Vendor Voice | Partner Voice |
|--------------|---------------|
| "We have completed the deliverable for your review" | "The dashboard's ready - here's what it unlocks for you" |
| "Please advise on next steps" | "I'm thinking we tackle X next. Sound right?" |
| "We will deliver this to you by Friday" | "We'll have this wrapped by Friday" |
| "If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out" | "Questions? Let's jump on a quick call" |
| "As your service provider, we recommend..." | "Based on what I've seen in your data, I'd suggest..." |

---

## When to Activate

**Triggers**:
- "Write a client email about [topic]"
- "Draft email to [client name]"
- "Help me respond to this client message"
- Client updates, proposals, follow-ups, issue resolution

---

## Email Categories

| Category | Purpose | Tone | Adapt When |
|----------|---------|------|------------|
| **Progress Updates** | Status, milestones | Informative, collaborative | Client wants more/less detail |
| **Deliverable Submissions** | Sharing work products | Confident, helpful | They prefer async vs. walkthrough |
| **Meeting Requests** | Scheduling | Respectful of their time | They have preferred booking methods |
| **Issue/Blocker** | Problems, solutions | Proactive, solution-focused | Urgency varies by impact |
| **Follow-ups** | Checking in | Non-pushy, value-add | Relationship warmth varies |
| **Scope Changes** | New work, adjustments | Collaborative, clear | Budget sensitivity differs |
| **Closing/Handover** | Project wrap-up | Warm, forward-looking | Future opportunity likelihood |

---

## Templates (Starting Points)

These templates are **starting points**, not scripts. Every email must be personalized to the client, project context, and relationship warmth.

### Template 1: Progress Update

**When**: Regular status updates (frequency set by client)

```
Subject: [Project Name] - [Key Update/Milestone]

Hey [Name],

Quick update on where we are.

WHAT'S DONE
• [Completed item with specific outcome]
• [Completed item with what it unlocks]

WHAT'S NEXT
• [Next task] - targeting [day/date]
• [Next task]

NEED FROM YOU
[Nothing / Specific item with clear deadline]

[OPTIONAL: HEADS UP - Any context they should know]

Anything I'm missing?

[Name]
```

**Adapt when**:
- More formal client → Add full greeting, "Best regards" sign-off
- Less technical client → Simplify language, explain outcomes not tasks
- High-touch client → Add more context, offer call option

---

### Template 2: Deliverable Submission

**When**: Sending work products for review

```
Subject: [Deliverable Name] Ready - [Project Name]

Hey [Name],

[Deliverable] is ready.

WHAT'S INCLUDED
• [Item and what it does]
• [Item and what it does]

WHAT THIS UNLOCKS
[One sentence on what they can now do / decide / see]

ACCESS: [Link or attachment info]

I'd suggest we walk through this together - [propose specific time] work? Otherwise, send over any questions and I'll clarify.

[Name]
```

**Adapt when**:
- Self-service client → Skip walkthrough offer, just provide access
- Complex deliverable → Add video walkthrough link
- Milestone deliverable → Add context on what's next in the journey

---

### Template 3: Meeting Request

**When**: Scheduling discussions

```
Subject: Quick chat - [Topic]

Hey [Name],

Want to align on [topic/purpose]. Should be [X] minutes.

What works for you this week? Some options on my end:
• [Day] [Time] ([their timezone])
• [Day] [Time]

Or grab a time here: [HUMAN INPUT REQUIRED - Calendly or booking link if you use one]

[Name]
```

**Adapt when**:
- Executive → Be more direct, propose single time
- Uses scheduling tool → Just send the link, skip the options
- Prefers async → Offer "or we can do this over email if easier"

---

### Template 4: Issue/Blocker Communication

**When**: Something went wrong or is delayed

```
Subject: [Project Name] - Update on [Issue]

Hey [Name],

Flagging something that came up.

WHAT HAPPENED
[Clear, honest description - no jargon]

IMPACT
[What this means for timeline/deliverable - be specific]

WHAT WE'RE DOING
• [Action 1] - [when]
• [Action 2] - [when]

I'll update you [when] with progress. If you want to talk through this, I'm available [time/day].

[Name]
```

**Key principles**:
- Lead with the issue (don't bury it)
- Own it if it's on us
- Always have a plan before sending
- Offer to discuss but don't require it

---

### Template 5: Follow-Up (Non-Pushy)

**When**: Checking in on unanswered items

```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hey [Name],

Circling back on this - no rush if you're swamped.

[One sentence reminder of what you need or where things stand]

Let me know if priorities shifted or if there's anything I can do to help move this along.

[Name]
```

**Adapt when**:
- Multiple follow-ups → Be more direct: "Want to make sure this isn't stuck"
- Decision blocker → Add context on impact: "Holding off on X until we hear back"
- Warm relationship → More casual: "Hey, this one still alive?"

---

### Template 6: Scope Change / Additional Work

**When**: Client asks for something new or scope needs adjustment

```
Subject: [New Request/Scope Item] - Options

Hey [Name],

Got your request on [item]. Here's how I'm thinking about it:

WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR
[Restate to confirm understanding]

OPTIONS
1. **Add to current scope** - [impact on timeline/budget]
2. **Replace [existing item]** - [what gets deprioritized]
3. **Phase 2** - [handle after current work completes]

MY RECOMMENDATION
[Option X] because [reasoning tied to their goals].

What feels right to you?

[Name]
```

**Link to**: See CLIENT-01 for full proposal methodology

---

### Template 7: Project Closing / Handover

**When**: Wrapping up an engagement

```
Subject: [Project Name] - Wrapped + What's Next

Hey [Name],

We did it. Here's where we landed.

WHAT WE DELIVERED
• [Outcome 1 - in terms of their business impact]
• [Outcome 2]
• [Outcome 3]

WHAT YOU CAN NOW DO
[One sentence on capability they now have]

HANDOVER
• [Documentation location]
• [Access/credentials info if applicable]
• [Support period details: X weeks/months for questions]

It's been great working with your team. [Specific genuine compliment about working with them.]

If anything comes up down the road, you know where to find me.

[Name]
```

---

### Template 8: Scope Creep Response (NEW)

**When**: Client asks "can you also..." mid-project

```
Subject: Re: [Their Request]

Hey [Name],

Good idea on [request]. Here's the thing - this wasn't in our original scope, so let me give you a clear picture:

IF WE ADD THIS NOW
• Timeline: [impact]
• Investment: [HUMAN INPUT REQUIRED - additional cost or "included in retainer"]

IF WE KEEP IT FOR LATER
• Can tackle this in Phase 2 / as a follow-up
• Won't slow down current momentum

I can go either way. What matters more to you right now - speed to completion or getting this in?

[Name]
```

**Tone note**: Not defensive. Not rigid. Just transparent about trade-offs.

---

### Template 9: Delay Communication (NEW)

**When**: We're going to miss a deadline or be late

```
Subject: [Project Name] - Timeline Update

Hey [Name],

Being upfront - we're not going to hit [original date] for [deliverable].

WHY
[Honest, brief explanation - technical complexity, dependency, underestimate]

NEW TARGET
[Specific date]

WHAT I'M DOING
[Action you're taking to get back on track]

I should have flagged this earlier. Let me know if this timing creates problems on your end - I want to make sure we're not blocking anything critical.

[Name]
```

**Key**: Proactive, takes ownership, offers to discuss impact.

---

### Template 10: Value-Add Suggestion (NEW)

**When**: You see an opportunity to help them further

```
Subject: Idea - [Brief Description]

Hey [Name],

Working on [current project] got me thinking.

WHAT I'M SEEING
[Observation about their business/data/process]

OPPORTUNITY
[What they could gain - be specific]

If this is interesting, I can put together a quick scope. No pressure - just wanted to flag it while it was fresh.

[Name]
```

**Tone note**: This is NOT a sales pitch. It's a partner noticing something helpful. Only send if genuinely useful.

## AI-Cringe Anti-Patterns

**Never use these phrases**:

| Phrase | Why It's Bad | Instead |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| "I hope this email finds you well" | Generic AI opener | Jump straight to the point |
| "Per my last email..." | Passive-aggressive | "Circling back on..." |
| "Please advise" | Corporate robot | "Let me know your thoughts" |
| "Please don't hesitate to reach out" | Robotic, no one hesitates | "Questions? Just reply" |
| "Touching base" | Empty phrase | State actual purpose |
| "As per our discussion" | Overly formal | "Following our chat..." |
| "I wanted to reach out regarding..." | Windup, no value | Start with the point |
| "At your earliest convenience" | Vague | Specific date or "when you get a chance" |
| "Moving forward..." | Corporate filler | Delete it |
| "Best, [Name]" with no context | Lazy sign-off | Match relationship warmth |

### More Anti-Patterns

- Starting with weather/weekend small talk (unless relationship warrants)
- Apologizing for "taking their time" (you're their partner, not an interruption)
- Multiple exclamation points (one max per email)
- ALL CAPS for emphasis (use bold instead)
- Corporate buzzwords (leverage, synergy, circle back, loop in)
- Hedging language when you're confident ("I think maybe possibly we could...")

## Tone Adaptation Guide

### By Relationship Stage

| Stage | Greeting | Sign-off | Formality |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Pre-engagement** | "Hi [Name]" | "Best, [Name]" | Professional, warm |
| **Early project** | "Hey [Name]" | "[Name]" | Professional, friendly |
| **Deep in project** | "Hey [Name]" or just start | "[Name]" or "-[Initial]" | Casual, efficient |
| **Long-term partner** | First name or start direct | Initial or nothing | Very casual |

### By Situation Urgency

| Urgency | Subject Line | Tone | Length |
|---------|--------------|------|--------|
| **Urgent** | Start with "URGENT:" | Direct, clear, action-focused | Short |
| **Normal** | Standard format | Balanced | As needed |
| **FYI only** | Include "FYI:" or "(no action needed)" | Light, informative | Brief |

---

## Response Time Guidelines

**Xyric Standard**: Respond within 24 hours, even if just to acknowledge.

| Email Type | Target Response |
|------------|-----------------|
| Urgent/Issue reported | Within 2 hours |
| Question needing answer | Same business day |
| FYI/Update | Acknowledge within 24 hours |
| Decision request | Within 24 hours (even if "need more time") |

**If you can't meet these**: Let them know when they'll hear back.

## Quality Checklist

Before sending any client email:

```
VOICE
[ ] Does it sound like a team member, not a vendor?
[ ] Is it personalized to this client/context?
[ ] Would I send this exact email to a colleague?

CLARITY
[ ] Is the purpose clear in the first line?
[ ] Are next steps obvious (theirs or ours)?
[ ] Can they skim it and get the point?

TONE
[ ] Matched to relationship stage?
[ ] No AI-cringe phrases?
[ ] Read aloud - does it sound human?

MECHANICS
[ ] Subject line specific and scannable?
[ ] Proofread for typos?
[ ] Right people CC'd (and no one extra)?
[ ] Attachments included?
```

---

## Difficult Situations

### When the Client is Wrong

Don't be defensive or superior. Be a partner correcting course:

```
"I see where you're coming from. Here's what I'm seeing in the data though -
[evidence]. Might change the approach. Worth a quick call to align?"
```

### When Delivering Bad News

Lead with it. Don't bury it in paragraph three:

```
"Flagging an issue - [state it clearly]. Here's what happened and what we're
doing about it. [Plan]. Happy to jump on a call if you want to talk through it."
```

### When Saying No

Be clear, not wishy-washy:

```
"I don't think we're the right fit for [request] because [honest reason].
What I can do is [alternative] - would that help?"
```

### When Following Up Multiple Times

After 2-3 attempts:

```
"Hey [Name] - circling back one more time on this. If priorities have shifted,
totally get it - just let me know and I'll close this out on my end."
```
