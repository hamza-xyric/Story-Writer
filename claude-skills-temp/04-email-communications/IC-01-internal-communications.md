- "Draft an internal announcement"
- "Help me communicate [news] to the team"
- "Write a contractor status update"
- Weekly syncs, project status, team announcements
- Internal Notion pages for documentation

## Xyric Communication Philosophy

| Principle | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Direct over diplomatic** | Say what you mean. Don't bury the lead. | "We missed the deadline" not "The timeline experienced some challenges" |
| **Progress over perfection** | Share early, iterate openly | Share work-in-progress, ask for input |
| **Context over assumptions** | Explain why, not just what | Include reasoning behind decisions |
| **Human over corporate** | Write like you talk | No robot-speak, no jargon soup |

### Voice Reference (from MKT-02)

```
Internal Communication Voice:
├── Direct: "Here's where we are and what's next..."
├── Collaborative: "We need to figure out X. Thoughts?"
├── Transparent: Share challenges, not just wins
└── NOT: "Management has decided that..." (corporate speak)
```

---

## Communication Types

| Type | Audience | Cadence | Primary Channel |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Team Sync** | Core team | Weekly | Email + Notion |
| **Project Status** | Contractors/Partners | Bi-weekly | Email |
| **Announcements** | All internal | Ad-hoc | Email + Notion |
| **Meeting Notes** | Participants + stakeholders | After meetings | Notion |
| **Investor Updates** | Investors/Advisors | Monthly | See EMAIL-03 |

## Anti-Patterns: What NOT to Sound Like

### Generic AI Output (AVOID)

```
❌ "I hope this email finds you well."
❌ "I wanted to reach out to provide you with an update."
❌ "Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions."
❌ "Moving forward, we will be implementing..."
❌ "As per our previous discussion..."
❌ "I trust this information is helpful."
❌ "Kind regards" (when you don't know them)
```

### Corporate Robot (AVOID)

```
❌ "Management has decided that..."
❌ "Please be advised that..."
❌ "It has come to our attention..."
❌ "Going forward, all stakeholders should..."
❌ "We are pleased to inform you..."
❌ "Synergy," "leverage," "circle back," "touch base"
```

### Over-Hedging (AVOID)

```
❌ "I was kind of thinking that maybe we could possibly..."
❌ "This might perhaps be something to consider..."
❌ "I'm not sure, but it seems like..."
```

---

## How to Sound Human

### Start with the Point
```
❌ "I wanted to send you a quick email to let you know about..."
✅ "We're pushing the launch to Friday."

❌ "After careful consideration of various factors..."
✅ "We decided to go with Option B. Here's why:"
```

### Use Active Voice
```
❌ "A decision was made to..."
✅ "We decided to..."

❌ "The project will be completed by..."
✅ "[Name] will finish by..."
```

### Be Specific
```
❌ "We made good progress this week."
✅ "We shipped the authentication flow and fixed 3 bugs."

❌ "The timeline may need adjustment."
✅ "We're pushing the deadline from Dec 10 to Dec 17."
```

### Vary Your Structure
```
✅ Short sentence. Then a longer one for context.
✅ Bullets for lists.
✅ Questions when you want input.
✅ Don't start every paragraph the same way.
```

### Include Personality (When Appropriate)
```
✅ "Honestly, this one took longer than expected."
✅ "Good news: we figured it out."
✅ "Quick heads up..."
✅ "Long story short: we're back on track."
```

---

## Format Guidelines

### Email Format
```
- Subject line: Specific, scannable, action-oriented
- Opening: Get to the point in first sentence
- Body: Bullet points for lists, short paragraphs
- Closing: Clear next steps or call to response
- Sign-off: Match the relationship (casual for team, professional for external)
```

### Notion Page Format
```
- Title: Clear and specific
- Quick summary at top (TL;DR)
- Use headers to structure content
- Tables for data/comparisons
- Checkboxes for action items
- Link to related pages
- Update timestamp and author
```

## Cadence Guidelines

| Communication | When | Who Sends | Recipients |
|--------------|------|-----------|------------|
| Weekly sync | Friday or Monday | Team lead | Core team |
| Project status | Bi-weekly | Project owner | Contractors + stakeholders |
| Meeting notes | Within 24 hours | Meeting organizer | Attendees + stakeholders |
| Announcements | As needed | Relevant owner | Affected parties |
| Investor updates | Monthly | CEO | Investors (see EMAIL-03) |

---

## Quality Checklist

Before sending:

- [ ] **Lead with the point**: Can someone understand the main message from the first sentence?
- [ ] **Scannable**: Can someone skim this and get the key info?
- [ ] **Actionable**: Are next steps and owners clear?
- [ ] **Human**: Does this sound like a person wrote it? Read it aloud.
- [ ] **Specific**: Are there concrete details, not vague statements?
- [ ] **Right audience**: Is this going to the right people? Not too many, not too few?
- [ ] **Xyric voice**: Direct, collaborative, transparent?

---

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration |
|-------|-------------|
| **EMAIL-01** | Client comms use similar principles but more formal tone |
| **EMAIL-03** | Investor updates follow specific format - defer to EMAIL-03 |
| **MKT-02** | Brand voice guidelines apply to all internal comms |
| **CORE-01** | Use `[HUMAN INPUT REQUIRED]` for estimates, timelines, financials |

---

## Common Scenarios

### Sharing Bad News
```
Lead with it. Don't bury.
✅ "We missed the deadline. Here's what happened and our plan to fix it."
❌ "I wanted to provide some context around recent developments..."
```

### Asking for Help
```
Be specific about what you need.
✅ "Need 15 min to review this doc before tomorrow's call. Available today?"
❌ "If you have a moment, it would be great if you could perhaps take a look..."
```

### Celebrating Wins
```
Be genuine, not corporate.
✅ "We shipped it! Thanks everyone—this was a team effort."
❌ "We are pleased to announce the successful completion of..."
```

### Changing Direction
```
Explain the why.
✅ "We're pivoting from X to Y. Here's why: [reason]. This means [impact]."
❌ "After strategic deliberation, leadership has determined..."
```
