## Purpose

Creates honest, structured monthly progress reports for internal accountability. This is a founder's tool for tracking what matters, reflecting on progress, and planning ahead. Not investor relations - self-discipline.

---

## The Xyric Way: Self-Accountability

### Why We Do This

We're self-funded. No external investors breathing down our necks. That freedom is dangerous without discipline.

Monthly progress reports exist to:
- Force honest reflection on what actually happened
- Track moonshot progress (the reason we exist)
- Connect consultancy work to the bigger mission
- Document learnings before they fade
- Plan with intention, not drift

### The Hierarchy

**Moonshot is the story. Consultancy enables the runway.**

| Priority | What | Why First |
|----------|------|-----------|
| 1 | DR AI Healthcare | The mission - WhatsApp AI healthcare for emerging markets |
| 2 | yHealth Platform | Foundation for DR AI - AI health coach |
| 3 | Consultancy | Revenue that funds the mission |
| 4 | Supporting Products | yBusiness, EverythingAI, TDW - when resources allow |

This hierarchy shapes every progress report. Lead with what matters most.

---

## When to Activate

**Triggers**:
- "Write monthly progress report"
- "Help me reflect on [month]"
- "Draft internal update"
- End of each month
- Major milestone reached

**Frequency**: Monthly (first week of each month, covering previous month)

---

## Section Deep-Dives

### Moonshot Progress

Track products by the 5-Stage Lifecycle (from EXPERT-10):

| Stage | Description | What to Report |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Vision** | Concept defined | "Maintained" or "Prioritization update" |
| **Feasibility** | Market/tech validation | Validation results, go/no-go progress |
| **Design** | UX/architecture | % complete, key decisions, blockers |
| **Development** | Building | Sprint progress, technical milestones |
| **Launch** | Live product | User metrics, feedback, iteration |

**Always include**:
- Current stage
- Progress metric if measurable
- Key learning from the month
- What's needed next

---

### Runway Status

This section keeps us honest about sustainability. Not for external reporting - for ourselves.

**What to track**:
- Active revenue-generating work
- Pipeline that could convert
- Cash position (if you're tracking it)
- Burn rate (if it varies)

**Green/Yellow/Red Assessment**:
- **Green**: 6+ months runway, pipeline healthy
- **Yellow**: 3-6 months runway, or pipeline concerns
- **Red**: <3 months runway, urgent action needed

---

### Symbiotic Learning

The magic of the dual business model: **consultancy isn't just revenue, it's research**.

Every client engagement teaches us something. This section captures it before we forget.

**Questions to ask yourself**:
1. What problems did clients bring us this month?
2. What patterns are we seeing across clients?
3. How does this inform yHealth or DR AI?
4. What skills did we develop that help the products?

**Example entries**:
```
### Client Patterns Observed
• 3/4 clients couldn't answer "what question are you trying to answer?"
  when we asked about their dashboard needs
• Everyone asks about "AI" but doesn't know what they actually need

### Product Insight Opportunities
• The "question before dashboard" insight validates BI-01 philosophy
• Could build this discovery process into yBusiness onboarding
```

---

### Decisions Needed

Self-accountability includes flagging decisions that need attention.

**Good decision entries**:
```
1. **DR AI: Go/No-Go on Development Phase**
   - Context: Feasibility complete, validated demand in 3 markets
   - Options:
     A) Start development Q1 (requires Salman focus shift)
     B) Wait until yHealth launches
     C) Hire dedicated dev for DR AI
   - Deadline: January 15 (blocks Q1 planning)
```

**Bad decision entries**:
```
1. "Need to decide on AI stuff"
   - No context, no options, no deadline
```

---

### Honest Reflection

This is the most important section. No spin, no excuses.

**What Went Well**: Not just things that happened - things YOU did that worked.

**What Didn't Go Well**: Be specific. "Didn't make enough progress" is useless. "Spent 15 hours on client work that could have been 8 if I'd scoped better" is useful.

**What We Learned**: The insight that changes future behavior. If nothing changes, you didn't learn.

---

## Report Types

### Monthly Progress Report (Default)

- Full template above
- 500-800 words
- Send to yourself (and co-founders if applicable)
- Archive for future reference

### Quarterly Deep-Dive

Every 3 months, add:
- Quarter-over-quarter trends
- Longer-term pattern analysis
- Strategic reassessment
- Next quarter planning

### Major Milestone Report

When something significant happens:
- What happened
- Why it matters
- What it changes
- What's next

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Be Honest

This is for YOU. Don't spin.

```
❌ "We made good progress on yHealth"
✅ "yHealth design went from 52% to 64%. Behind target (was aiming for 75%).
    Lost 2 weeks to client fire drill."

❌ "Consultancy is going well"
✅ "1 active engagement, 2 proposals out. Pipeline weaker than last month.
    Need to prioritize outreach."
```

### Be Specific

Numbers > adjectives.

```
❌ "Worked a lot this month"
✅ "55 hours on client work, 20 on yHealth, 5 on DR AI"

❌ "Made progress on design"
✅ "Completed 8 of 12 remaining screens"
```

### Be Forward-Looking

Every section should connect to "what's next."

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing:

```
HONESTY
[ ] Did I report what actually happened, not what I wish happened?
[ ] Are the "didn't go well" items as detailed as "went well"?
[ ] Would I be embarrassed reading this in 6 months?

COMPLETENESS
[ ] Moonshot progress covered?
[ ] Runway status clear?
[ ] Symbiotic learning captured?
[ ] Decisions needing attention flagged?

USEFULNESS
[ ] Can I act on next month's priorities?
[ ] Did I capture learnings before forgetting them?
[ ] Is this report useful to future-me?

MECHANICS
[ ] Numbers verified?
[ ] No [HUMAN INPUT REQUIRED] left unfilled?
[ ] Archived in accessible location?
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping months when things are hard** (that's when reports matter most)
- **Only tracking good news** (defeat the purpose)
- **Vague reflections** ("could have done better" - at what?)
- **No symbiotic section** (missing the dual model magic)
- **No decisions flagged** (drifting instead of deciding)
- **Treating this as marketing** (it's accountability, not PR)

---

## Archive & Reference

Keep all progress reports in:
- `COMPANY/progress-reports/YYYY-MM-progress.md`
- Or Notion database (Internal Updates)

Review quarterly:
- Are we tracking what matters?
- What patterns emerge over time?
- Are we making progress on the moonshot?

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Honest assessment of progress
- [ ] Moonshot progress clearly tracked
- [ ] Consultancy → Product connection captured
- [ ] Decisions needing attention surfaced
- [ ] Actionable priorities for next month
- [ ] Learnings documented before forgotten
- [ ] Report useful for future reference
