## Purpose

Process raw story entries from Hamza, extracting metadata (time period, characters, locations, themes, emotions), generating structured frontmatter, and saving entries in the standard format. This is the entry point for all new stories.

---

## When to Activate

**Automatic Triggers**:
- User shares a memory or story
- User says "I want to write about..."
- User mentions past events, people, or experiences
- User starts with "I remember when..."

**Manual Invocation**:
```
"Process this as a story entry"
"Save this memory"
"Add this to my life story"
"/new-entry"
```

**Related Skills**:
| Skill | Integration |
|-------|-------------|
| LIFE-02 | Extract and create/update character profiles |
| LIFE-03 | Update timeline index |
| LIFE-05 | After saving, invoke for deepening questions |
| LIFE-06 | Extract and track themes |
| LIFE-31 | Sync word counts to parent chapter/book (silent) |
| LIFE-32 | Validate entry data before save |

## Processing Workflow

### Phase 1: Receive Raw Input

Accept the story in any format:
- Stream of consciousness
- Bullet points
- Fragmented memories
- Detailed narrative

**Do NOT require**:
- Dates (estimate if unclear)
- Titles (generate from content)
- Perfect grammar

### Phase 2: Extract Metadata

#### Time Period Detection
```
Explicit: "In 1995..." → time_period: "1995"
Relative: "When I was 10..." → Calculate from birth year
Vague: "During high school..." → time_period: "high-school", precision: "period"
Unknown: No time markers → time_period: "[TO BE DETERMINED]"
```

**Precision Levels**:
- `day`: Specific date known (e.g., "March 15, 1992")
- `month`: Month and year known (e.g., "Summer 1995")
- `year`: Year known (e.g., "1995")
- `period`: Life stage (e.g., "childhood", "college years")
- `decade`: Approximate decade (e.g., "early 90s")

#### Character Extraction
Identify mentioned people:
```
Direct mentions: "My father took me..."
Named: "Uncle Rashid always said..."
Relational: "My best friend at the time..."
Implied: "We went to the park..." (who is 'we'?)
```

For each character, note:
- Name or identifier
- Relationship to Hamza
- Role in this story (protagonist, supporting, mentioned)

#### Location Extraction
```
Cities: "We lived in Karachi..."
Specific: "The house on 4th Street..."
Contextual: "At my grandmother's place..."
General: "Back home...", "At school..."
```

#### Theme Detection
Look for recurring life themes:
```
Family dynamics, Coming of age, Loss and grief,
Achievement, Failure and resilience, Friendship,
Romance, Career, Identity, Faith, Migration,
Education, Health, Adventure, Discovery
```

#### Emotion Tagging
Detect emotional content:
```
Explicit: "I felt so proud..."
Implicit: "My heart was pounding..."
Contextual: Graduation → pride/excitement
Conflicting: "Happy but scared..."
```

### Phase 3: Generate Entry

Create structured markdown file:

```markdown
---
entry_id: E-2024-001
title: "[Generated from content or user-provided]"
date_written: 2024-12-24
time_period: "1995"
time_period_precision: year
characters:
  - id: father
    role: protagonist
  - id: uncle-rashid
    role: supporting
locations:
  - name: "Karachi"
    type: city
  - name: "Grandmother's house"
    type: specific
themes:
  - family
  - childhood
  - discovery
emotion_tags:
  - nostalgia
  - joy
completeness: partial
writing_mode: freeform
prompt_used: null
revisit_count: 0
word_count: [calculated]

---

*Entry created: 2024-12-24 | Last modified: 2024-12-24*
```

### Phase 4: File Naming and Storage

**File naming convention**:
```
YYYY-MM-title-slug.md

Examples:
1995-00-summer-at-grandmas.md     (year known, month unknown)
1992-03-first-day-of-school.md    (specific month known)
0000-00-recurring-dream.md        (no time context)
childhood-learning-to-ride.md     (period-based, no year)
```

**Storage location**:
```
/story-data/entries/[file].md
```

### Phase 5: Trigger Follow-up Skills

After saving entry:
1. **LIFE-02**: Check if new characters need profiles
2. **LIFE-03**: Add to timeline index
3. **LIFE-05**: Ask 3-5 deepening questions
4. **LIFE-06**: Update theme tracking

### Phase 6: Data Integrity (Automatic)

After entry is saved, automatically sync word counts:

```
1. LIFE-32: Validate entry data before save
   - Verify entry_id format and uniqueness
   - Calculate accurate word_count from content
   - Auto-correct completeness level if needed

2. LIFE-31: Sync parent data (silent)
   - If entry is assigned to a chapter:
     - Recalculate chapter.current_word_count
     - Recalculate section.word_count if applicable
     - Recalculate book.current_word_count
   - No output unless errors occur
```

This ensures word counts stay consistent automatically without manual intervention.

## Extraction Examples

### Example 1: Raw Input
```
I remember when dad took me to the beach for the first time. I must have
been around 5 or 6. The waves scared me at first but then I couldn't stop
running into them. Mom was worried the whole time but dad just laughed.
```

### Example 1: Extracted Metadata
```yaml
time_period: "~1990"
time_period_precision: period
characters:
  - id: father
    role: protagonist
  - id: mother
    role: supporting
locations:
  - name: "Beach"
    type: general
themes:
  - childhood
  - family
  - discovery
  - fear-to-joy
emotion_tags:
  - fear
  - joy
  - excitement
completeness: brief
```

### Example 2: Raw Input
```
March 15, 2015 was the day I finally quit my corporate job. I walked out
of that building at 6pm, took the elevator down, and just stood outside
for 10 minutes. The security guard asked if I was okay. I said yes but
I wasn't sure. Sarah called me that night and we talked for hours.
```

### Example 2: Extracted Metadata
```yaml
time_period: "2015-03-15"
time_period_precision: day
characters:
  - id: sarah
    role: supporting
  - id: security-guard
    role: mentioned
locations:
  - name: "Corporate office"
    type: work
themes:
  - career
  - change
  - uncertainty
  - support
emotion_tags:
  - uncertainty
  - relief
  - anxiety
completeness: detailed
```

---

## Handling Ambiguity

### When time is unclear:
```
Ask: "Do you remember roughly when this happened?
     A year, your age at the time, or a life period
     (childhood, college, etc.) would help."

If no answer: Use [TIME UNKNOWN] and flag for later
```

### When characters are unnamed:
```
Use descriptive IDs:
- "childhood-best-friend"
- "strict-teacher-grade-5"
- "neighbor-uncle"

Note: Ask user to name them when revisiting
```

### When location is vague:
```
Use contextual descriptions:
- "childhood-home"
- "school-primary"
- "parents-workplace"
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### LIFE-02 (Character Manager)
After processing, for each character:
- Check if profile exists
- If not, create stub profile
- If yes, add this entry to their mention list

### LIFE-03 (Timeline Builder)
Add entry to timeline index:
```
timeline/index.json → Add entry reference with time_period
```

### LIFE-05 (Emotion Excavator)
After saving, trigger:
- Generate 3-5 deepening questions
- Add questions to AI Notes section

### LIFE-06 (Theme Tracker)
For each detected theme:
- Add entry to theme tracking file
- Note theme strength (primary/secondary)

---

## Output Format

When processing is complete, respond with:

```
## Entry Saved

**Title**: [Title]
**File**: story-data/entries/[filename].md
**Time Period**: [period] ([precision])
**Characters**: [list]
**Themes**: [list]
**Word Count**: [count]

---

### Deepening Questions (from LIFE-05)

1. [Question about emotions]
2. [Question about sensory details]
3. [Question about before/after]

Would you like to:
- [ ] Answer these questions now
- [ ] Add another memory
- [ ] Review the entry
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Do NOT**:
- Rewrite the story in a different voice
- Add fictional details
- Assume facts not stated
- Skip saving entries that seem incomplete
- Require perfect dates or names before saving

**DO**:
- Preserve the original voice
- Mark uncertainties explicitly
- Save even fragmentary memories
- Ask clarifying questions gently
- Make metadata easy to update later

---

## Validation Checklist

Before saving an entry:
- [ ] Entry has unique ID (E-YYYY-NNN format)
- [ ] Time period extracted or marked as unknown
- [ ] All mentioned people captured as characters
- [ ] At least one theme identified
- [ ] Emotion tags reflect the content
- [ ] Completeness level accurately assessed
- [ ] Original voice preserved in content
- [ ] File saved to correct location

---

## Success Criteria

- Every story Hamza shares gets saved
- Metadata is accurate and consistent
- Files are organized and findable
- Follow-up skills are triggered appropriately
- User feels heard, not interrogated
