# The TF/Shaco Days

I think my whole life I've always wanted to write it but as I grow older, I start to think that my life is really so packed with events and it's always so fun to think about the events and relive them with friends or telling about it. As I grow older, I think I'm starting to also forget some events on how important they were.

A random duo partner from the days of League of Legends, a huuuge part of my life, messaged me on Steam and I couldn't really recognise his name. He told me his League name and I thought it was familiar and then he mentioned "our TF / Shaco duo so amazing" and then it hit me.

I really went through such a nice nostalgic feeling that I had forgotten. A memory that I really loved and really defined a certain time of my life. How I used to think I was the best at League of Legends.

I started thinking how many other things I've gone through, how many other phases I've gone through. At other times, I've thought about the friendships I've built, how they were built, the memorable days, the core memories. There are just so many things that have happened and I really want to cherish them and write it all out.

Trinkhalm. That was his name. And for a moment, hearing about our TF/Shaco combo brought back a whole era I'd almost lost.

And genuinely, there was this random guy I used to duo with. I used to play with him a lot, a lot, a lot. And then I don't know how or why—I mean, I guess I know why. I added him on Steam and just forgot about him. Haven't spoken to him in years.

He messaged me and I'm like, who are you? He tells me his name and I'm like, I don't know you. He's like, maybe you'd remember my League name. Yeah, that name seems a bit familiar, but I was still not interested. Some random guy messaging me out of nowhere.

And then he mentions TF/Shaco.

Shit man. The memories that just came back. I started thinking—these are my core memories and I don't even remember them anymore. There are so many other memories as well that just start to fade away over time. I don't want these things to fade away.

It's nice to capture it. Doesn't really matter what my thoughts are—I just want to write it down. And then sooner or later, things that seem very small and insignificant, like this guy. He's "insignificant." I didn't even remember his name. Even now, if you asked me what his name was, I really had to think. It was a nickname. I don't even remember. But it was still something.

I had this conversation today about how games shaped me—Warcraft, League of Legends, Neopets. I remember when I was maybe six years old trying to make HTML pages because that's what Neopets was about. The community aspects of things. That got into how my brain works, why it is how it is. I want to store all of this.
