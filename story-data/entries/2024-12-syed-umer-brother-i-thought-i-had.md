# The Brother I Thought I Had

## Origins

I don't really have many or any memories of Syed Umer pre grade 11. He just seems to have appeared out of nowhere. There is a running joke of whether he joined grade 7 or 8 because of how no one really remembers.

One thing I can think of is that I remember he was basically part of the weird group of people: Nadeem (who turned out to be gay), Medhat (who acted gay but isn't), Mehdi (turned out to be extremist Shia) and some others. Can't really put a finger on what it was but I remember Ahsan Khan—my best friend at that time—also mentioned him as a bit weird.

However I can't remember when I first spoke to him, how he approached me, how we clicked or anything. I just remember grade 12 is when we became friends. Grade 12 is when Ahsan left, Tosif left, Ibti left and I didn't really have any new friends. I remember grade 12 was when Omer, Bilal and I became best friends. Everyone grew up, everyone matured and we had a really good time. The Three Musketeers. That's a story for another time.

## Post-School: The Bond Grows

We finished school and everyone was looking at what to do. Bilal and I went to AUS and Syed Umer went to Heriot Watt.

Now, I can't fully remember how or what but we used to text a lot. Random jokes, fun jokes and etc. Before I knew it Syed Umer was a very close friend of mine. He went to Malaysia after his foundation year in HW and we stayed in touch. We would meet when he would come back and it was good.

He was really good at understanding me, making me feel good about myself. I really don't remember much and I might if I go through our old chats but 2015-2019 he would come every year and we would bond more and more.

I remember by 2017, he changed a bit. We wouldn't text as much and he wouldn't really put in any effort. At that point I couldn't be bothered because all my texting efforts were spent with Neveen and I wouldn't really think too much about it. I still don't know to this date, what happened in that year that he hasn't mentioned.

---

## The Deep Trust

2018-2019, is when shit gets crazy. He came back and we would tell each other everything. I would tell him about my family, financials, girls or anything else that I had in my mind. It's funny because I remember once I heard Mufti Menk once said that don't talk about everything. Your friends at the end of the day are just friends. And I was like no, Syed Umer is different. He's basically more than a blood brother.

Anyways, Syed Umer apparently failed the same course 3 times and was kicked out of the major. He told me about it, lied to everyone else and I felt really bad but in my mind I thought he's just unfortunate. As I haven't mentioned it yet, he's very smart, very logical and has more potential than anyone and everyone I have met—or so I thought.

He told everyone there are visa issues and he isn't able to go back and everyone else felt bad for him too. No one really thought too much about it. Before Pandemic, he mentioned he's gonna go to Pakistan and pandemic hit he was there. He said he can't appeal because he can't go to Malaysia.

Apparently, that's also a lie because Aqeel's brother appealed on his behalf and he got accepted but he just ghosted all his Malaysia friends and didn't really do anything about this. By this point, he has given up and didn't wanna go to Uni—apparently just didn't care and wanted to have a good life.

## The Financial Support

Now, as years are progressing, Alhamdullilah Bilal and I both are getting more stable financially and our friend who's having a tough time and struggling has started to be supported by us.

I don't have much details about those years but I do remember that more or less every friend that Syed Umer has become friends with and spends time with was more or less someone who I introduced by just taking him with me when meeting.

He hasn't really ever asked for friendships, plans, adventures but I just really always have the mentality, he's my brother and if I'm enjoying then I would want him to enjoy as well or else it won't be as fun.

I can't go into total detail without spending a lot more time but we basically became inseparable. Alhamdullilah, I was financially strong, I could support my unfortunate friend and still enjoy a lot. It became a thing, regardless of where we go, I will pay. Does it make sense for someone who is not earning anything to let him pay when you earn 20k? Well that's what I thought and I really never really thought about it twice.

## The Rebecca Revelation

I remember Aqeel came to UAE once, had a long conversation and he told me about Rebecca. Who's Rebecca? She's the girl Syed Umer dated since grade 4 till grade 11. She's a blonde British girl who also used to visit Syed Umer at their house, mother was fine because she also liked her and that was that. Unfortunately, after grade 11—no hard feelings but they broke up because they both wanted to pursue different things in life. They stayed best friends apparently. I remember in uni, when he told me about her he mentioned that she got cancer and didn't have much long to live. Last thing I remember being told is that unfortunately, she was involved in a car accident.

I remember Aqeel coming and telling me that all of this is made up. There is no girl called Rebecca and he made her up in uni and there were other friends like Jeet who can back this up. Anyways, everything was going well—Aqeel wasn't even a friend of mine, Syed Umer was basically one of my best friends. Why should I even take this into consideration. I thought about it and let it go.

---

## The Trading Era

Fast forward, Syed Umer said he's starting uni again, University of Nottingham. That's exciting news because regardless of the unfortunate events he's finally moving on with life. Finally gonna finish a degree and do something.

In the meantime, I have recently gotten into trading and seeing the dreams of the lifetime, dreams to be multi millionaires right in front of my eyes. Trying my hardest day and night to make it happen, seen GameStop, seen Covid, seen many different things that led me to discuss a life that is awaiting. I obviously included Syed Umer in my plans, because he's just unfortunate that's all—lagging behind else he would be the same.

I think he got very used to this lifestyle. I'm there, Bilal is there, Omer is there. Everyone is doing good. Why should Syed Umer need to put in effort? At the end of the day the money you can see in the stock market is just something you can never see working a 9-5 job ever. Bilal funds him, Omer funds him, I fund him.

Aside from trading money, I buy him everything money would need anyways. Clothes, iPhones, AirPods, headphones, resorts, multiple fully funded trips, Umrah, the 100 times we went padel, badminton, including him in gifts, any kind of food that we need to eat, electricity bill, monthly just spending money, credit card, you name it.

He had mentioned repeatedly that how lavish his life was but then after the 2008 crash, his father lost everything and since then it's a loss-making business. Not sure how a loss making business stays afloat for 17 years so that's also questionable. Regardless, because of that him spending money was out of the question.

At some point in time, I guess he stopped going to uni if he ever did. Kept mentioning 2 more semesters for years and years. Never completed anything, kept lying about it to everyone who would ask.

---

## The Breaking Point

I remember the gig was up when I last gave him money to trade, 5k dollars and he kept losing money consecutively and I warned him once, twice, thrice about changing his style and then I got upset and I told him off. He didn't respond to me, he just ignored the message.

I waited, I was furious, how is it possible that you won't even acknowledge me? We even had a trip planned—some resort in Dibba, something that was also paid for but he didn't even mention anything in person. Fast forward, new week, he says sorry the chat somehow got archived and he didn't see. I was angry but then he mentioned his father had a heart attack. Obviously, I let go of everything that I was furious about. He's my brother, I felt the same as if my father had a heart attack. I called my parents instantly and told them to see if anything is required especially financially.

My mother called her and then texted her, she didn't respond. She responded after a while and was very apologetic, in a good mood and said herself what she was up to—busy with tuition, busy with Nani's doctor appointment for an ear infection and other non serious things. When my mother got to know she didn't mention anything about the heart attack and just talked casually and everything seemed fine. She told me that I might have misheard and that was that.

---

## The Umrah Experience

We went to Umrah, he was very off, he seemed very weird. I guess that's when I really actualized my thoughts and thought about who is really sleeping next to me. I don't know him. I don't know anything about him. I don't know if he goes to uni, I don't know if his father had a heart attack, idk if he also lies to his parents—as his mother said it might be difficult for him to go for Umrah as its exams week. I don't know about the girl he talks to 24/7. Why does she live in Palestine? Why does he never mention her to me? Who is he?

I got very sick when I went to Madina, I remember very well that each step I took towards Medina after leaving the taxi, each step got heavier as I reached the hotel. I was quite sick but I had one goal to go to Riaz ul Jannah. I had mentioned it. I went to sleep really wanting to go and I woke up at 11 by myself. I saw to my right he's awake and chilling. I remember panicking because I was really sick and I told Syed Umer that go on ahead I'm weak and will be slow to reach and rather than both missing at least he should try to make it.

He reached. I didn't. I was depressed. I went home and I really wanted to talk about it and have someone console me. He came and didn't say much. Just said he didn't know that was the time of our appointment even though we had long conversations about it. I was really heart broken, I just wanted him to say it's okay you wanted to go it's fine your intentions count. Nope he didn't say anything.

Fast forward, walking in the airport leaving Medina, each step made it lighter for me. Each step made my sickness less. By the time I was in the airplane, I was fully recovered. It was weird, I joked that the place was too pure for me so I was sick and left it there. It doesn't work like that but regardless. I never thought too much about it.

We come back and turns out he tells Owais that he went to Riaz ul Jannah twice. I didn't know, Owais told me later and I was shocked, how? Why would he not tell me? It really made no sense to me. Why would he not tell me?

---

## The Withdrawal

Fast forward, I had been talking to him less as I had decided to not to reach out to him anymore and he would not reach out either ways. We would still meet when there are group plans, Bilal would pick him up, padel/badminton, chill sessions, etc. I would still pay for everything, it was just a given thing. No matter what, I am the free ATM who he doesn't even talk to anymore. I guess deep down I was thought I was overthinking, wrong about it and was too scared to face the truth also scared of what he will say.

It was obvious, visible to everyone, I don't interact or talk anymore. He's just there.

---

## The Oil Trade Incident

Fast forward, there was an opportunity we saw at Owais' wedding and I told Omer that if we do this oil play it would make sense. Syed Umer from the side quietly asked Omer if he can also put his money in. Time went on, we got the trade set up and the play ready and then I executed it all. I remember the next event of Owais' wedding after that we went to Rabbash and there was Raqeeb, myself and Syed Umer. I saw the trade and then executed it and closed it in profit. Syed Umer while sitting next to me did not comment on anything, he messaged Omer after I closed it for profit and asked if my profit was secured. Omer embarrassingly said yes and then he told me and I got so pissed. It was so manipulative and insane but Omer wanted to just let it deduct it from his amount. Bilal was the one who paid out, who was also unaware of this risk-free trading management that was transferred. Syed Umer, who owed money already and all just replied Jazakallah. That's it.

---

## The Final Confrontation

Fast forward, I messaged him couple of months after resigning and still paying for 2 people no matter where we go and do that I will no longer be able to manage this as I do not have a salary anymore. I remember that before I messaged the reality I did not want to face was that he wouldn't even say thank you. I had mentioned this to Owais prior to messaging him and then that's what happened. He said he already had it in mind and he was planning on paying me back for it which of course he did not.

Now after this he disappeared as no one was willing to pay for him for around ~25 days in which he came back and mentioned to everyone that he was really really sick and has thyroid. In the 25 days, I discovered he had borrowed money from Bilal and Omer both. Now he came back saying he's very sick when both Bilal and Omer had set deadlines and of course now that the friend is sick.

He also mentioned that he has cancer. At this point I had mentioned to my mother that I don't talk to Syed Umer, he's a liar and now he's going around telling people that he's sick. I told my mother not to mention anything but just let me know if his mother tells her anything. She told me that they just spoke a while ago and she had said Syed Umer's mother will be calling her on Saturday. Turns out without even my mother asking anything, she decided to give an update on everyone and tell how she is the daughter of a renowned doctor so she is very health conscious and does regular health checks to ensure everything is okay. She mentioned that all her children were passed off as completely healthy with only the nani having some health issues which is thyroid. Owais asked Syed Umer how her Nani is and he just said she's not well and when asking further what's wrong he just said 'oh you know just the usual old age health related issues'.

## The Pattern Revealed

Fast forward I don't know why but I was sick for most of my UAE trip and it could be another coincidence but I noticed the exact same thing—as I was leaving UAE, I was starting to feel better and by the time I reached Lahore, I was 100% recovered.

He has been a compulsive liar since school apparently and has been leeching off everyone while having this image of a very prestigious individual and family who is very well off while is doing literally nothing.

The type of person Syed Umer is I feel like he isn't living for anything. He is clinically depressed and psychopathic.

We used to make jokes of:
- Emotionless—for everything and everything I would say this applies to you
- Fake—everything and anything he does is not real and he just fakes everything
- Gaslighter—he is the best manipulative person to turn someone around

I used to make these jokes on a daily basis, my jokes really were how I felt but at the end when I said it out loud it always sounded so silly that I would laugh it off but I genuinely would have made these jokes almost everyday and have reasoning behind them.

## Spiritual Concerns

What I am worried about is the fact that he might have been involved in black magic. I really felt it today when I reached home back in Lahore and sat down. I was connecting the dots, Umrah, Malaysia, UAE trip and the fact that I know for sure that my mother had been so worried for me this whole year and would come everyday without fail to make ruqiya in the morning and at night before I sleep. I would come home so late so many times and my mother would be up and always there waiting for me and then go to sleep. I would get very annoyed or upset that Amma doesn't go to sleep and she doesn't need to do so much. Better to just sleep. Then I can also just be out and be relaxed. I felt like my mother was worrying for no reason.

I felt the difference, I felt the difference in my life, I felt how everything, literally everything about me has changed in the last 3-4 months. Everything just became so easy and so smooth. Everything just falls into pieces. Everything is just great. I couldn't understand why.

My mother mentioned that she had a feeling since she came from Pakistan around August last year that something happened. She felt it in her heart and just made dua'a that Allah protect my children from black magic. She said she didn't know what to do, she didn't want to say anything out loud because she said no one will understand and everyone will just laugh.

I told her how I felt today and she opened up and told me all of this. Only I know how much my mother has thought about me this last year. Only my mother knows how much she had to tolerate me and be patient. Only Allah knows how patiently and difficult it has been for my mother.
