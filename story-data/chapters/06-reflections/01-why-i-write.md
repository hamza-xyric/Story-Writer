# Why I Write

## Chapter Summary

This chapter serves as the origin story of the entire book. It explains why I'm writing my life, how I plan to do it, and what I hope to capture. It's both introduction and manifesto - setting the stage for everything that follows.

---

## Opening

*Draft notes for the chapter opening:*

> "I have been wanting to write a book my whole life."

Start with this simple truth. Then the confession - all the times I almost started. What stopped me. Why this time is different.

---

## Key Scenes

### Scene 1: A Lifelong Dream
- **Entries**: E-2024-001
- **Characters**: None (internal)
- **Notes**: The dream of writing, the previous attempts, the questions that stopped me

### Scene 2: The Breakthrough
- **Entries**: [TBD - need to capture this moment]
- **Characters**: None
- **Notes**: How AI changed things. The realization that I could write fragments and have them organized. The system that finally made it possible.

### Scene 3: The Vision
- **Entries**: E-2024-001 (partial)
- **Characters**: None
- **Notes**: What the book will be - my cat today, university tomorrow, friends from then, self from now. Piecing together a life.

### Scene 4: The Why
- **Entries**: E-2024-002 (reference)
- **Characters**: None
- **Notes**: Why this matters. The fear of forgetting. The Trinkhalm moment. "So much that happens that doesn't get captured."

---

## Transitions

- This chapter can serve as Prologue or Epilogue
- Links to every other chapter as the "why" behind them
- The Trinkhalm memory (C-001-03-01) is the first concrete example of what we're saving

---

## Closing

*Draft notes for the chapter ending:*

Return to the vision. This book isn't history - it's emotional truth. It's not for anyone else - it's for me. And yet, maybe someday, it's also a gift to whoever wants to know who I was.

> "And then kind of just like my whole life. And then be like, yes, this is me."

## Prose Draft

<!-- Actual chapter prose goes here when drafted -->
<!-- LIFE-21 Chapter Generator will populate this section -->

[Draft prose will appear here after generation...]

---

## Writing Notes

- This might work better as Prologue than Epilogue - TBD
- Keep the original voice - raw, conversational, not overly polished
- The determination should come through
- Reference the cat, university - tease what's to come

---

## Questions to Resolve

- Previous writing attempts - what were they? What stopped them?
- Who is the cat mentioned?
- What university memories feel most urgent?
- Should this be Prologue or Epilogue or both (bookends)?
