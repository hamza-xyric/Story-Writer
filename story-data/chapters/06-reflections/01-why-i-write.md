# Why I Write

## Chapter Summary

This chapter serves as the origin story of the entire book. It explains why I'm writing my life, how I plan to do it, and what I hope to capture. It's both introduction and manifesto - setting the stage for everything that follows.

---

## Opening

*Draft notes for the chapter opening:*

> "I have been wanting to write a book my whole life."

Start with this simple truth. Then the confession - all the times I almost started. What stopped me. Why this time is different.

---

## Key Scenes

### Scene 1: A Lifelong Dream
- **Entries**: E-2024-001
- **Characters**: None (internal)
- **Notes**: The dream of writing, the previous attempts, the questions that stopped me

### Scene 2: The Breakthrough
- **Entries**: [TBD - need to capture this moment]
- **Characters**: None
- **Notes**: How AI changed things. The realization that I could write fragments and have them organized. The system that finally made it possible.

### Scene 3: The Vision
- **Entries**: E-2024-001 (partial)
- **Characters**: None
- **Notes**: What the book will be - my cat today, university tomorrow, friends from then, self from now. Piecing together a life.

### Scene 4: The Why
- **Entries**: E-2024-002 (reference)
- **Characters**: None
- **Notes**: Why this matters. The fear of forgetting. The Trinkhalm moment. "So much that happens that doesn't get captured."

---

## Transitions

- This chapter can serve as Prologue or Epilogue
- Links to every other chapter as the "why" behind them
- The Trinkhalm memory (C-001-03-01) is the first concrete example of what we're saving

---

## Closing

*Draft notes for the chapter ending:*

Return to the vision. This book isn't history - it's emotional truth. It's not for anyone else - it's for me. And yet, maybe someday, it's also a gift to whoever wants to know who I was.

> "And then kind of just like my whole life. And then be like, yes, this is me."

I have been wanting to write a book my whole life.

I think there have been a lot of different occasions when I almost started one. I'd get this urge, you know, and I'd think about all the things I wanted to say, all the stories I wanted to tell. But then the questions would come. How do I start? What do I include? What order does everything go in? There were just too many things I didn't know how to manage, so I didn't.

Now with how AI can really tailor and help you with everything, I came up with this idea. Not just to write a book, but to document my whole life.

My idea is simple. I didn't wanna just sit down one day and start writing from beginning to end. That felt impossible. Instead, I wanna slowly just write on it. Whatever I'm thinking about at the moment, that's what I write. Like if I feel like thinking about my university right now, I write about my university. Tomorrow I don't feel like thinking about anything. And then suddenly I have this urge to think about my cat. And then I just start writing about my cat.

I wanna do this and I want AI to kind of just put the pieces in place and keep on building a story. Because what I'm gonna be talking about are different characters—friends from different times, family, people who shaped me. I'm gonna be talking about different events. I'm gonna be talking about myself at different times. How I was when I was young. How I am now. The friends I had then, the friends I have now. And then kind of just like my whole life. And then be like, yes, this is me.

Book is just nice and cool to say. But at the end it's kind of a detailed dream. I want my emotions in there and I generally want to express myself as much as I can. So I don't forget this later on.

There will obviously be a lot to add, a lot of changes, a lot of different ideas. It's very cool and I really feel like there is so much that happens that doesn't get captured. I wanna capture all these moments before they fade away.

- Re-generate chapter when profile reaches 5+ confirmed patterns
- Target score: 0.90+ (possible after 10+ entries)

---

## Writing Notes

- This might work better as Prologue than Epilogue - TBD
- Keep the original voice - raw, conversational, not overly polished
- The determination should come through
- Reference the cat, university - tease what's to come

---

## Questions to Resolve

- Previous writing attempts - what were they? What stopped them?
- Who is the cat mentioned?
- What university memories feel most urgent?
- Should this be Prologue or Epilogue or both (bookends)?
