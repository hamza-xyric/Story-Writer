# The League Years

## Chapter Summary

This chapter explores the League of Legends era through the lens of a forgotten friendship. When Trinkhalm messaged on Steam years later, it triggered memories of a time when gaming wasn't just a hobby - it was identity. The TF/Shaco duo, the feeling of being the best, the friendships that formed in digital worlds.

---

## Opening

*Draft notes for the chapter opening:*

Open with the Steam notification. The confusion of not recognizing the name. Then the moment "TF/Shaco duo" unlocked everything - a whole era flooding back.

---

## Key Scenes

### Scene 1: The Message
- **Entries**: E-2024-002
- **Characters**: Trinkhalm
- **Notes**: Steam notification, confusion, then the flood of memory. The feeling of almost losing something precious.

### Scene 2: The Duo
- **Entries**: [TBD - need to capture this memory]
- **Characters**: Trinkhalm
- **Notes**: What made the TF/Shaco combo work. The strategies, the wins, the feeling of dominance. How did two strangers become this synchronized?

### Scene 3: The Era
- **Entries**: [TBD]
- **Characters**: [Other League friends?]
- **Notes**: Broader context - what life was like during this time. Where was I? What else was happening? How did gaming fit into the bigger picture?

### Scene 4: The Fade
- **Entries**: [TBD]
- **Characters**: Trinkhalm
- **Notes**: How did we lose touch? Why did this era end? Not sad - just the natural flow of life.

---

## Transitions

- Connect to "Why I Write" chapter - this experience is WHY memory preservation matters
- May connect to other gaming phases if those chapters are written
- The "forgotten and remembered" theme links to broader memory thread

---

## Closing

*Draft notes for the chapter ending:*

Return to present - looking at the message on Steam. What it means that we forget. What it means that sometimes, unexpectedly, we remember. Tie back to the larger project of writing life.

> "Trinkhalm. That was his name. And for a moment, hearing about our TF/Shaco combo brought back a whole era I'd almost lost."

## Prose Draft

<!-- Actual chapter prose goes here when drafted -->
<!-- LIFE-21 Chapter Generator will populate this section -->

[Draft prose will appear here after generation...]

---

## Writing Notes

- Need more entries about this era before full drafting
- Consider reaching out to Trinkhalm for his perspective?
- Find old screenshots if possible
- Other League friends to include?
- What season of League was this?

---

## Questions to Resolve

- What season of League was this exactly?
- How long did the duo partnership last?
- What rank did we achieve together?
- What happened to end it - drift or sudden?
- What other games/eras came before and after?
- How did we meet initially?
