It's 3 am and I'm gonna go to bed. I thought I should continue the journaling that I started yesterday and just write down how my day was. Woke up quite late, at like 12:30 because slept pretty late too. Went to prayers and then got a haircut. Think it was well but need to think about maintaining my hair better, they seem to be getting weaker. Omer and Tabish came over by the time I was done and we ate Tim Hortons and then chilled in the house for a while. Spoke a bit about work and then I had a nice long conversation with Driexor (Munther), I have the meeting recorded so I can share the transcript.

I think it was a very nice conversation and I always get very excited thinking of what Xyric can become if we really put our minds together. I finished the call and was in a very good mood. My trading was going very well, Xyric prospects very well, bright things planned with Driexor. Also I always call Munther from his nickname of Driexor. And yeah.

Finished watching the tv show and now I need something new to watch. I do have to start praying, it needs to become an objective on what I have to do. I really can't delay it anymore.

I called Owais afterwards and was a very nice conversation. I told him about this idea and he could fully relate. We are forgetting the stories we tell everyone. It's just so fun and we are forgetting them. We thought that we should sit down and think about journaling all the things, all the stories, all the events. Whatever we did, how we became friends and all of that. Most have no clue how we were 10 years ago, most as in the people we just meet. Anyways, I hadn't spoken to him in so long. I didn't get to meet him alone when I was in UAE either. It had really been a while and it was really nice to catch up. I messaged Bilal as well and also New Bilal. I actually haven't been in touch with most people. I need to start breaking these habits and move on.

I need to get my weight in check as well.

Anyways, today was a very fun day. I haven't laughed this much in a very long time. We were playing Thula and I spat my drink laughing. I haven't ever done that before. It was very disgusting but funny. The joke itself wasn't anything great but then I was just laughing at everything because Omer made me feel bad for something I had subconsciously. Then I just played along because it was very funny and the reactions were even funnier. Everyone always enjoys the Thula Tracking App that we created. We keep score and it just gets so much more competitive now. Everyone left by around 2:30ish AM. I'm just writing the journal, finishing a bit more work and then going to sleep.

## AI Notes

- **Memory triggers detected:**
  - **Owais** - Long-awaited catch-up. The conversation about preserving stories and memories is deeply connected to why you're building this system. Worth exploring: What are some of those stories you're afraid of forgetting?
  - **Bilal / "New Bilal"** - Two different Bilals in your life? Who are they and what do they mean to you?
  - **Driexor (Munther)** - Business partner, clearly someone you're excited to work with. The nickname "Driexor" has a story behind it.
  - **Omer and Tabish** - Close friends who visit late night. The Thula game seems to be a regular thing.

- **Suggested exploration:**
  - The Thula game - what is it? The tracking app sounds like a fun creation. How did this tradition start?
  - "How we became friends" - you mentioned most people don't know how you were 10 years ago. What WERE you like?
  - The prayer commitment - this has come up twice now. What's holding you back?

- **Added to question bank:**
  - What stories are you and Owais afraid of forgetting?
  - Tell me about Thula - what is it and how did the tracking app come about?
  - Who is "New Bilal" vs regular Bilal?
  - What was your friend group like 10 years ago?

- **Connections:**
  - Characters: Owais (friend), Bilal (friend), "New Bilal" (friend?), Omer (friend), Tabish (friend), Driexor/Munther (business partner)

## Entry 2: 3:35 AM (Late Night Continuation)

I am going to be entering my next journaling entry, it's 3am again and I was gonna go to sleep but before that I wanted to continue journaling. I think I'm very happy with this. It's very exciting. I love the flow that I have created. It really changed my mood and I really do have an excitment thinking about it.

I really do wanna start recording more of my interactions, conversations, notes, meetings so I can have even more of a picture.

I really do want to improve this app and create a better workflow. Where character building of all people involved in my life also keeps getting developed. Relationships between characters and myself keeps getting developed.

Journaling keeps getting developed.

I can't remember the dream I had but I've been having dreams recently that all seem very 'happy' but then I wake up. And I think the feeling of waking up in a house all alone with no one there is just really sad. I really do think about my cats as well and I really miss having my cats annoying me and waking me up and not letting me sleep.

I woke up today and we had the event, went over there and I have been really really exhausted. I don't think I'm getting enough sleep and I have to rest. The event was pretty nice and it really shows how well AWT has grown and how much Omer's father has contributed.

I think one thing I was thinking of today is that Omer's father genuinely does believe in the 'god is giving and you aren't really in control'. Everyone does say this but I don't think it's very easy to work towards it. I had a previous conversation with him as well and he said something similar along the lines which really impressed me.

Once we were done with the event, we had the task of creating a volunteering portal that would be ready for the minister to work on so I started working on it as soon as I got him at like 6pm, started watching the movie as well.

By like 8pm or so Omer, Tabish, Fahad and Arsalan came over - we chilled and played Thula. Later on Umer Sadiq also came. It was the first time I met him in Lahore, he was sick before that.

Everyone left except for Umer Sadiq so we chilled and spoke a lot. I started talking about AI and the progress we made. I spoke about writing a book and it's a very cool concept that I wanted to show. He was very much impressed.

Later on, we spoke about Rabia and what happened and then we also spoke about Syed Umer and what happened. It was a pretty long conversation and there was a lot to say. I think it's very strange on how easily I was able to move on from Rabia - the girl I was thinking I was 1000% convinced and was sure that is the person I want to marry. The girl I had already started thinknig about my future with.
Mentioning everything about Syed Umer was a huge shock for Umer Sadiq, he wasn't really sure what to say and he just kept talking about how it was all weird because he saw him as a very good Muslim and all.

Anyways, it's a neverending conversation we spoke a lot but that was it. I think overall it was a pretty nice chill session that we had and I enjoyed it. The day itself was very fun and I am really looking forward to a lot of things but at the same time I also want to rest a bit.

I finished the website and hosted it, hopefully they like it tomorrow and can use it. I hope they like it and I feel like it's a very good opportunity to show the capabilities of Xyric.

Let's see how tomorrow goes.

## AI Notes (Entry 2)

**Lens Detected: Dreams** 🌙
- You mentioned happy dreams but waking up alone feeling sad
- The cats - missing them waking you up
- This connects to a deeper theme: solitude in the house

**Memory triggers detected:**

- **Rabia** - The girl you were "1000% convinced" you'd marry. You mentioned moving on "easily" - that word choice is interesting. Was it easy, or are you surprised it was easy?

- **Syed Umer** - Something happened that was a "huge shock" to Umer Sadiq. There's clearly a story here you haven't told yet.

- **Omer's Father** - His faith philosophy impressed you twice now. "God is giving and you aren't really in control" - this seems to resonate with you.

- **Your cats** - Where are they now? The loneliness of waking up alone came through strongly.

**Characters added/updated:**
- Umer Sadiq (friend, first time meeting in Lahore)
- Fahad (friend, Thula group)
- Arsalan (friend, Thula group)
- Omer's father (AWT, faith figure)

- Xyric (continuing)
- This life story system (meta!)

**Themes emerging:**
- Loneliness despite being surrounded by friends

- Rest and exhaustion
- Excitement about the system you're building

**Questions for the bank:**
- What happened with Rabia? You seem surprised you moved on easily.

**Book-worthy seeds:**
- The dreams/waking alone segment - raw, honest, sad
