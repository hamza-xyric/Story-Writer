Thursday night or Friday morning 6am. I am now finishing my day. Was a pretty long day, woke up in the morning and then had the meeting Dr. Qaiser at Shahid Uncles house. I think the product is nice, I think the execution is really important for it to happen. I think it fits very well with the idea that we have for Dr. AI and would really complement well together. We spent like 4 hours over there discussing things, we decided that we'll schedule a 3 day workday where we sit down and really document the strategy very well on how they wanna proceed.

When I came home, was pretty exhausted and went to sleep. I had a dream about Rabia, I feel like it was the first time I can vividly remember a dream with her in it. We had made up, things were not perfect but I had my head laid on her lap and we were just kind of talking. I woke up and it felt very strange because that thought that I wanted to be close to her and want to know her is gone and that dream is just a dream.

I sat down and started watching the show Pluribus, it has that girl from Better Call Saul who I really like. A very nice strong woman portrayed both in Better Call Saul and also in this show. At the same time, started working. Was working simultaneously in 3 different things, xyric-kb, research for the HomeCare project and also for this story writing workflow/app that we are thinking of.

I am very very happy with the result that came out and how I'm journaling right now. I think it's something that can even be turned into a product. Very interesting idea. Tabish and Omer came and then I told them about it as well, very exciting. I think this can also be a sub component of yHealth Wellness. Adding an 'AI Coach' on top of the journaling would really give a lot of insights. Something to really think about.

We watched Conjuring 1 and Paranormal Activity 1 and it was pretty scary not gonna lie, it's very crazy to think about what all does actually happen and how it's proof of Islam. Just that we all are too weak and ignorant to see the signs and do what's right. I read an Ayah today about the 'zulm' we do on ourselves by just not being good muslims. And if only I was able to comprehend it just now. I need to be a better Muslim. it's something that I really need to work on.

Just some thoughts, I think I should call Bilal, Owais and others - it's been a while since I've spoken to anyone.

Anyways, I'm going to bed. I thought I would make some progress writing the book but I didn't. Thought I'll just freestyle a journal entry to start using more functionalities.

## AI Notes

- **Memory triggers detected:**
  - **Rabia** - Dream surfaced complex feelings. The contrast between what the dream felt like and the waking realization that "that thought is gone" is poignant. Could explore more when ready.
  - **Bilal, Owais** - Friends you haven't spoken to in a while. What's keeping you from reaching out?
  - **Shahid Uncle, Dr. Qaiser** - Professional relationships worth documenting in characters/

- **Suggested exploration:**
  - The dream about Rabia - what was it like before things changed? What did "wanting to know her" mean to you?
  - The religious reflection - what was the Ayah? What does being a "better Muslim" mean to you specifically?
  - The fear from the movies connecting to faith - that's an interesting thread

- **Added to question bank:**
  - Tell me about Rabia - who was she to you?
  - What does your faith mean to you? How has it evolved?
  - When was the last time you spoke to Bilal and Owais? What do those friendships mean?

- **Connections:**
  - Characters: Rabia (romantic?), Bilal (friend), Owais (friend), Dr. Qaiser (professional), Shahid Uncle (professional), Tabish (friend), Omer (friend)
  - Projects mentioned: xyric-kb, HomeCare, Dr. AI, yHealth Wellness, Story Writing system
  - Themes: faith/Islam, friendship, work/ambition, processing past relationships, nostalgia
