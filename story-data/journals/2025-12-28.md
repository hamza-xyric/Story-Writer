I'm writing a new journal on Sunday 28th 2025. I just came back from the second day of the event of AWT Annual Gala and honestly it's so inspiring. How selfless of an organization it is and how the orgaization operates like a business. Really exciting to see this from the inside.

I think both days I felt very out of place, I think I thought quite a bit that like I'm not really part of this, these achievements aren't mine. I don't contribute either and like I'm getting so much respect for no reason. Today I met the Minister of Education and Shahid Uncle introduced me to him. Basically it feels wrong that I'm part of everything just because I am Omer's friend. At the same time, I don't think they are doing it for nothing - they want me involved because they see my potential and they trust Omer's judgement. Inshallah, I wish in the upcoming year I am very excited to contribute through Xyric for the ambitious plans that Omer and Shahid Uncle have. At the same time, inshallah I wanna be in a position where I can be a large contributor myself. The work they do is very amazing, it's honestly something everyone should witness. It's very humbling.

I've been feeling very tired and I really need to take a break and relax a bit. I seem to be very exhausted all the time, I'm not even eating well and my constipation isn't really getting much better. I think it might be something to do with the Pizza that it's not the best thing to eat. I'm gonna try to switch to Desi food only and see how it changes things. I'm really thinking of so many things to do and I really wanna do so many things when it comes to developing and making progress in Xyric.

First things first, I need to learn to manage these people better. I don't know why it's so difficult for me to execute the logical things I've already thought about 5000 times on how I can be the best manager. It's what I'm trying to slowly keep on getting better, the same kind of message I've been trying to talk to Driexor about. The more things get streamlined, the more I can focus on other things like strategy and also the more I don't need to be at the top of their heads all the time.

I think today I'm gonna work a bit more on the Story Writer and think of additions and improvements that can be made in the system and make thigns more stricter. At the same time, I think I'll start answering more of the questions that have been listed out already.

## AI Notes

- **Memory triggers detected:**
  - **Imposter syndrome** - "These achievements aren't mine... getting respect for no reason." This is a theme worth exploring. When have you felt this before? What would it take to feel like you've "earned" your place?
  - **Shahid Uncle & AWT** - You're witnessing something special from the inside. The organization runs "like a business" but is selfless - that's rare. What specifically impressed you?
  - **Management struggles** - "Thought about 5000 times how to be the best manager" but can't execute. What's the gap between knowing and doing?

- **Health note:**
  - Exhaustion, poor eating, constipation mentioned. Third consecutive late-night journal. This is a pattern worth watching.

- **Connections:**
  - Characters: Omer (friend, gateway to AWT), Shahid Uncle (AWT leader, mentor figure), Driexor/Munther (business partner), Minister of Education (new)
  - Organizations: AWT (Al-Wahab Trust?), Xyric
  - Themes: imposter syndrome, ambition, health/self-care, leadership, contribution vs receiving
  - Links to: J-2025-002 (AWT Day 1, Omer's father's philosophy)

- **Questions for the bank:**
  - When else have you felt like an imposter? What helped you overcome it?
  - What would "earning your place" at AWT look like to you?
  - What's blocking you from being the manager you know you can be?
  - Tell me more about what AWT does - why is it so inspiring?
