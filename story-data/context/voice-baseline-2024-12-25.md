## Emerging Voice Patterns

### Vocabulary (Emerging)

**High-Frequency Words:**
- "really" (8+ occurrences across both entries)
- "just" (6+ occurrences)
- "I want/wanna" (5+ occurrences)
- "think" (5+ occurrences)
- "kind of" (3 occurrences)
- "like" (used as filler, 4+ occurrences)

**Signature Phrases:**
- "a lot, a lot, a lot" (emphatic repetition)
- "I'm like" (informal dialogue marker)
- "kind of just" (softening phrase)
- "Shit man" (emotional exclamation)
- "core memories"

**Emotional Vocabulary:**
- Nostalgia: "nostalgic", "relive", "cherish", "memories"
- Determination: "want", "wanna"
- Reflection: "think", "as I grow older"

### Sentence Patterns (Emerging)

**Characteristics:**
- Mix of short and medium sentences
- Uses fragments for emphasis ("Trinkhalm. That was his name.")
- Rhetorical explanations ("My idea is simple.")
- Stream-of-consciousness flow

**Estimated Average Sentence Length:** ~18 words (needs formal calculation)

**Fragment Usage:** Occasional (2-3 per entry)

### Narrative Patterns (Emerging)

**Opening Style:**
- Often starts with "I" + verb ("I think...", "I have been wanting...")
- Sets personal context first

**Closing Style:**
- Ends with reflection or future intent
- "I want to store all of this"
- "I wanna capture all these moments"

**Flow:**
- Chronological with tangents
- Uses section breaks (---) for topic shifts
- Explains reasoning behind thoughts

### Sensory Preferences (Emerging)

| Sense | Observations |
|-------|--------------|
| Conceptual/Emotional | Dominant - feelings, thoughts, memories |
| Auditory | Some - "he mentioned TF/Shaco" |
| Visual | Minimal so far |
| Olfactory | None |
| Tactile | None |
| Gustatory | None |

### People References (Emerging)

- Uses nicknames: "Trinkhalm"
- Informal: "this random guy", "some random guy"
- Collective: "friends"

## Ghostwriter Readiness

**Current State:** NOT READY for full ghostwriting

**Reasoning:**
- 0 confirmed patterns (need 5+ occurrences)
- 2 entries insufficient for reliable voice matching
- Sensory palette incomplete
- Need more emotional vocabulary samples

**Fidelity Score Expectation:** 0.60-0.75 (moderate match)

**To Improve:**
- Capture 3-5 more entries
- Include more emotional memories (to build emotional vocabulary)
- Include sensory-rich memories (places, moments)
- Include people-focused memories (to learn reference style)

## Growth Tracking

### Entry Milestones

| Milestone | Entries | Expected Outcome |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Current | 2 | Baseline established |
| 5 entries | 5 | 3-5 confirmed patterns |
| 10 entries | 10 | 10-15 confirmed patterns |
| 25 entries | 25 | Full voice profile |
| 50 entries | 50 | Rich ghostwriting capability |

### Voice Evolution Triggers

Re-analyze and update profile when:
- [ ] 5 entries reached
- [ ] 10 entries reached
- [ ] First confirmed pattern (5+ occurrences)
- [ ] New emotional vocabulary discovered
- [ ] Sensory preferences emerge
- [ ] Person reference patterns stabilize

---

## Next Steps

1. **Continue capturing** - Each entry adds data points
2. **Diversify topics** - Include different life periods
3. **Include sensory memories** - Places, moments, physical experiences
4. **Voice recordings** - To capture spoken patterns (may differ from written)
5. **Re-analyze at 5 entries** - Update baseline comparison
