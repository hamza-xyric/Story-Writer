# Hamza's Writing Context

## About This File

This is your personal voice profile. It captures how you write, speak, and tell stories - growing richer with every session. When I generate prose or ask questions, I use this file to sound more like YOU, not generic AI.

## Current Understanding

### Writing Voice
**Emerging patterns (based on 2 entries, 895 words):**
- Conversational, reflective tone
- First-person perspective with stream-of-consciousness flow
- Uses repetition for emphasis ("a lot, a lot, a lot")
- Informal language (wanna, I'm like, Shit man)
- Opens with "I" statements, closes with future intent or reflection

### Speaking Voice
Not yet established - send voice recordings to capture how you speak differently than write.

### Key Themes
**Emerging themes:**
- Memory preservation and fear of forgetting
- Gaming/digital life (League of Legends, Warcraft, Neopets)
- Nostalgia and "core memories"
- Self-documentation and life story

### Sensory Style
Currently conceptual/emotional dominant. Sensory details (visual, auditory, etc.) are minimal in early entries - may emerge with more descriptive memories.

### Session Notes
- Profile initialized: December 24, 2024
- Profile version: 2.1 (first voice analysis)
- Baseline established: December 25, 2024
- Entries analyzed: 2 (E-2024-001, E-2024-002)
- Next milestone: 5 entries for confirmed patterns

## How Voice Capture Works

1. **You share memories** - through freeform writing, conversation, or voice
2. **I analyze patterns** - vocabulary, sentence structure, emotional words, sensory preferences
3. **Patterns gain confidence** - emerging (1-2x) → growing (3-4x) → confirmed (5+x)
4. **This file updates** - with confirmed patterns only
5. **Ghostwriter mode uses this** - to write prose that sounds like you

## What I Learn Over Time

| Category | What I Track |
|----------|--------------|
| **Vocabulary** | Words you use often, phrases unique to you, words you avoid |
| **Sentence Style** | Length, complexity, use of fragments |
| **Narrative Flow** | How you open stories, how you end them, how you transition |
| **Emotional Words** | Your specific words for joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, nostalgia |
| **Sensory Preferences** | Which senses you naturally describe (visual, auditory, etc.) |
| **People References** | How you refer to family and friends (Dad vs father, etc.) |
| **Sensitive Topics** | Areas to handle gently or avoid unless you bring them up |

## Ghostwriter Promise

When I write as you (drafts, chapters, polished prose), I will:
- Only use vocabulary from your confirmed patterns
- Match your sentence length and rhythm
- Use your opening/closing styles
- Reference people the way YOU do
- Never add words you don't use
- Never sound like generic AI

The more you write, the more I become your voice.
