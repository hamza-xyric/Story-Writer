# Aqeel

## Who They Are

Friend connected to Syed Umer's Malaysia circle. His brother helped Syed Umer appeal his university dismissal and got him accepted—but Syed Umer ghosted everyone and never followed through.

Came to UAE and revealed to Hamza that Rebecca (the girlfriend Syed Umer claimed to have dated since grade 4) was entirely fabricated. Other friends like Jeet corroborated this.

At the time of this revelation, Hamza dismissed it because Syed Umer was his best friend and Aqeel "wasn't even a friend of mine."

## Key Memories

1. **The Rebecca revelation** - Long conversation in UAE where Aqeel revealed the fabricated girlfriend story. Others (Jeet) backed this up.

2. **The appeal** - Aqeel's brother appealed on Syed Umer's behalf and got him accepted back to university. Syed Umer ghosted the opportunity.

## Their Impact
Was the first to try to open Hamza's eyes about Syed Umer's pattern of lies. Though dismissed at the time, his information proved accurate.

## Relationships
- **Connected**: friends/syed-umer - Malaysia circle
- **Corroborated by**: Jeet (not in system yet)

## Unresolved Questions
- What else does Aqeel know about Syed Umer's time in Malaysia?
- How did Aqeel know Hamza well enough to share this?
