# Omer

## Who They Are

One of Hamza's closest friends. Part of the "Three Musketeers" from grade 12 along with Bilal and Syed Umer.

Financially stable as an adult. Also contributed to financially supporting Syed Umer over the years. Set repayment deadlines that Syed Umer avoided by claiming illness.

Was the target of Syed Umer's manipulation during the oil trade—Syed Umer quietly asked him to put money in, then after Hamza closed for profit, messaged Omer asking if "my profit was secured." Omer embarrassingly agreed, essentially getting a risk-free trade at Omer's expense.
