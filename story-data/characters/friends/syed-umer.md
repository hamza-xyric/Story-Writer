# Syed Umer

## Who They Are

Former close friend who Hamza considered "more than a blood brother." Over 10+ years, Syed Umer was part of the Three Musketeers friend group and became a deeply trusted confidant. The relationship was characterized by Hamza's extreme generosity and trust, and Syed Umer's exploitation of both.

Revealed to be a compulsive liar whose fabrications included: an entirely fictional girlfriend (Rebecca) with an elaborate backstory, fake university enrollment, a fabricated family medical emergency, and false personal health claims. Pattern of lying traced back to school years.

## Physical Appearance

[Not yet captured]

## Voice and Mannerisms

[Not yet captured]

Hamza's daily jokes that described Syed Umer (said as jokes, but meant seriously):
- "Emotionless" - applies to everything
- "Fake" - nothing is real
- "Gaslighter" - best manipulator at turning things around

## How They Changed Over Time

### School Years (Grade 7-12)
Part of the "weird group" at school. Unmemorable—running joke about whether he joined grade 7 or 8 because no one remembers. Became friends with Hamza in grade 12 when other close friends (Ahsan, Tosif, Ibti) left. Formed the "Three Musketeers" with Bilal and Omer.

### University Era (2015-2019)
Texted frequently, visited annually from Malaysia. Good at making Hamza feel understood and valued. Bond deepened significantly. 2017: something changed (unexplained to this day)—effort dropped, texts stopped.

### Deep Trust Era (2018-2019)
Became like blood brothers. Hamza shared everything—family, finances, relationships. Believed the usual rules about keeping some distance from friends didn't apply to Syed Umer.

### Exploitation Era (Pandemic - 2024)
Fully funded by friends—Hamza, Bilal, Omer. Given: clothes, iPhones, AirPods, headphones, trips, resorts, Umrah, padel/badminton sessions, food, electricity bills, monthly spending money, credit card, 5k for trading. Never contributed financially. Story about father's business losing money since 2008 crash used to justify this.

### Revelation (2024)
Pattern exposed: Rebecca was fabricated, university claims false, father's heart attack lie, health claims contradicted by his own mother. Disappeared for 25 days when funding stopped, returned with more health claims (thyroid, then cancer). Now estranged.

## Key Memories

1. **The Rebecca revelation** - Aqeel revealed there was never a girlfriend named Rebecca. The entire story (dated since grade 4, cancer, car accident) was fabricated.

2. **The father's heart attack lie** - Used to deflect confrontation about trading losses. Hamza's mother called Syed Umer's mother who mentioned nothing about it, was casual and upbeat.

3. **The Umrah experience** - Syed Umer was "off" and weird. Went to Riaz ul Jannah twice, never told Hamza who missed it due to illness. No consolation offered.

4. **The oil trade manipulation** - Quietly asked Omer to put money in trade Hamza set up. After profit, texted Omer asking if profit was secured—manipulating a risk-free position for himself.

5. **The 25-day disappearance** - Vanished when funding stopped. Returned claiming thyroid and cancer. His own mother's health update to Hamza's mother contradicted all claims.

## Their Impact

Fundamentally changed Hamza's view of:
- Generosity and its limits
- Trust and red flags
- The difference between what someone says and who they are
- His own tendency to dismiss his instincts (the daily jokes that were true)

Introduced spiritual concerns: possible black magic connection, explained by pattern of sickness in his presence (Madina, UAE) and recovery when away.

Mother's protective prayers (ruqiya) for a year now make sense in retrospect.

## Relationships

- **Three Musketeers**: friends/bilal, friends/omer - Core friend group from grade 12
- **Revealed lies**: friends/aqeel - Exposed the Rebecca fabrication
- **Implicated**: Multiple friends (Jeet, others in Malaysia) confirmed patterns

## Unresolved Questions

1. What happened in 2017 that changed him?
2. Did he ever actually attend University of Nottingham?
3. Who is the Palestinian girl he texts 24/7?
4. Is there truth to the black magic concerns?
5. Is he clinically depressed or actually psychopathic as suspected?
6. What is his family's actual financial situation?
7. How much does he lie to his own parents?
8. Is he capable of changing?
