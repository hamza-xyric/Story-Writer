# Trinkhalm

## Who They Are

A duo partner from the League of Legends days. We had an amazing TF/Shaco combo that defined a gaming era. He reached out on Steam years later, triggering a wave of nostalgia about a time I'd almost forgotten.

## Physical Appearance

[Unknown - online gaming friend]

## Voice and Mannerisms

[Unknown - online gaming friend]

## How They Changed Over Time

### League of Legends Era (Late 2000s - Early 2010s)

We were duo partners. He played Shaco, I played Twisted Fate. The combo was "so amazing" - his words when he messaged me on Steam after all these years.

### Reconnection (2024)

He reached out on Steam. I didn't recognize his name at first until he mentioned our duo.

## Key Memories

- The TF/Shaco duo queue days
- The feeling of being "the best" at League
- Him messaging on Steam years later

## Their Impact

Represents a whole era of gaming that shaped how I spent my time and who I was during that period. The fact that I almost forgot this friendship shows how much we lose if we don't document our lives.

## Unresolved Questions

- How did we meet originally?
- What rank did we reach together?
- What happened that we lost touch?
- What's his real name?
