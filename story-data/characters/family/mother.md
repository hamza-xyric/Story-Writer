# Amma (Mother)

## Who They Are

Hamza's mother. A deeply protective and spiritually aware presence in his life. She sensed something was wrong with Hamza around August of the previous year and has been consistently making ruqiya (protective prayers) for him every morning and night for an entire year—even waiting up late at night when he came home.

Her patience and dedication went largely unappreciated in the moment, with Hamza sometimes feeling annoyed that she wouldn't just go to sleep. In retrospect, he recognizes how much she sacrificed and tolerated.

## Key Memories

1. **The protective year** - Made ruqiya every morning and night for a year, waiting up no matter how late Hamza came home.

2. **The intuition** - Had a feeling since coming from Pakistan (August previous year) that "something happened." Didn't say anything because "no one will understand and everyone will just laugh."

3. **The investigation** - Called Syed Umer's mother after the "heart attack" claim, discovered no mention of it—the mother was casual and upbeat, talking about tuition and Nani's ear infection.

4. **The confirmation** - When Hamza finally told her about his realizations in Lahore, she opened up about all she had been silently doing to protect him.

## Their Impact

Her patient, silent protection over an entire year—making prayers twice daily without complaint—represents the unseen love and sacrifice of a mother. Her spiritual intuition proved accurate.

"Only I know how much my mother has thought about me this last year. Only my mother knows how much she had to tolerate me and be patient. Only Allah knows how patiently and difficult it has been for my mother."

## Unresolved Questions
- What exactly did she sense in August?
- How did she know to start the ruqiya?
- What else has she silently protected Hamza from over the years?
