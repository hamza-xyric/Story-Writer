# My Life Story

## Overview

This book captures my journey from childhood to the present day. It follows a **hybrid structure**: chronological life phases provide the backbone, while thematic threads weave through time to connect related memories.

The book is being written piece by piece - not in order, but following whatever memories call to me. The system helps organize fragments into a coherent narrative, learning my voice along the way.

---

## Dedication

[To be written when the book takes shape]

---

## Epigraph

> "I really want to cherish them and write it all out."
>
> — From my first entry, 2024
