I have been wanting to write a book my whole life. I think there have been lots of different occasions when I had almost started to write one but I just never could. There were too many questions that I didn't know how I would be able to manage so I didn't. Now with how AI can really tailor and help you with everything I came up with this idea to write a book. To document my whole life.

My idea is simple. I didn't wanna just sit down one day and start writing a book. I wanna slowly just write on it. I wanna write about what I'm thinking. Like if I feel like thinking about I don't know my university right now. I started about my university. Tomorrow I don't feel like thinking about anything. I don't know anything. And then suddenly I have this urge to think about my cat. And then I just started writing about my cat. And I wanna do this and I want AI to kind of just put the pieces in place and then keep on building a story because what I'm gonna be talking about are different characters. I'm gonna be talking about different events. I'm gonna be talking about myself at different times. Like how I was when I was young. Um, how I am now. Um, the friends I had then, the friends I had now. And then kind of just like my whole lives. And then be like, yes, this is me. Book is just nice and cool to say. But at the end it's kind of detailed dream. But um, I want my emotions in there and I generally want to express myself as much as I can. So I don't forget this later on.

The text in there to also think a bit more on what I am thinking or writing about. There will be obviously a lot to add, a lot of changes, a lot of ideas, a lot of different things. It's very cool and I really feel like there is so much that happens that doesn't get captured and I wanna capture all these moments.
